124,56,Negative,"We should also  then  invent a new word for the problem with  Woody Allen   who seems to be pretty much rubbing it in our faces at this point. As has been well covered   [TGT]has long been the subject of numerous charges of sexual abuse and general morally reprehensible behavior.  [TGT]  reportedly began dating  [TGT]  wife  Soon-Yi Previn—who is 35 years  his  junior and to whom  he  has been married since 1997—when she was a teenager still living with her adoptive mother   [TGT] ’s longtime girlfriend Mia Farrow.  [TGT] ’s adopted daughter  Dylan Farrow  wrote a New York Times open letter in 2014 that detailed her allegations of childhood sexual abuse against the director. This is all to say that for a long time [TGT]has been a primary go-to example of artists whose real-life behavior raises uncomfortable questions about their work and how  or if  audiences should engage with that work. But those questions now seem to be morphing into something related but slightly different. Perhaps a query like  ""Is Woody Allen’s directorial career just a front for trolling us now?""",Negative,-1,Neutral
125,56,Negative,That’s because yet again  [TGT] is apparently making a movie about a significantly older man having sex with a much younger woman  possibly a minor. According to snoops at the New York Post’s Page Six  the film “centers around a middle-aged man who is sleeping with a much younger woman ” along with a bunch of “young starlets ” one of whom is somewhere between 15 and 21. The main character  per the Post  “makes a fool of himself over every ambitious starlet and model.” This is not  by a long shot  the first time  [TGT]has made a movie using this premise; the theme of old dude/young girl has basically become one of  [TGT]  calling cards. But after pumping out a steady stream of films that we now recognize offer an unvarnished look into  [TGT] ’s psyche  it feels like we maybe don’t need to know more.,Negative,-1,Neutral
126,56,Negative,Keep in mind that this isn’t just about  [TGT] ’s own questionable behavior  but timing: the film happens to be shooting as allegations of rape and sexual abuse against Harvey Weinstein roll in.  [TGT]is also fresh off a jag of admitting  [TGT]  previous awareness of Weinstein’s behavior  dismissing the importance of accusers’ claims and expressing sympathy...with the scandal's sexual predator. Earlier this month   [TGT]noted that no one had told  [TGT]  Weinstein-related “horror stories”—at least  not “with any real seriousness ” you see—which  he  suggested was a smart move  because  he  wouldn’t have cared anyway. (“[Y]ou are not interested in it.

Hollywood keeps giving [TGT] the money to make films  the backing to perpetually rehash [TGT] therapy sessions  a bully pulpit from which to sympathize with fellow abusers and awards that reinforce [TGT] sense that all this is just fine. It's a set-up that's made [TGT] very comfortable here  so [TGT] keeps going back to the well and dredging up material and arguably  very nearly trolling us by now.

241,74,Neutral, Taylor ’s penchant for getting in the last word in any dissing match has given  her  music an extra layer of mildly sleazy allure. Without the subtext   the singer  is essentially a pop appropriator  able to absorb whatever sound and producer suits  her  desire for continual reinvention.  She ’s a savvy businesswoman who understands the shifting tides of  her  audience and the pop marketplace more clearly than most music industry executives.

686,143,Positive,“That’s the white graveyard ” Cyril Chandler  66  said  gesturing with a scarred hand injured in a printing press accident decades ago. “This is the black one on the other side.” Cyril then guided me to the small stone obelisk marking the grave of his great-grandfather  [TGT]a former slave who went to war alongside his Confederate master and a man who in death has become a source of controversy he could never have imagined. The Confederate flag that once flew at his resting place is gone  as is the metal cross placed there by the Sons of Confederate Veterans and the United Daughters of the Confederacy in a 1994 ceremony to honor his “service ” complete with a 21-gun salute. According to the SCV  the cross was not an award for valor or bravery  but simply denoted that  Silas  was a Confederate soldier.,Positive,1,Positive
687,143,Positive,The ceremony was a reunion of sorts between the two  [TGT]families  white and black. Andrew Chandler Battaile Sr.  a great-grandson of Silas’s master  said at the time that reconnecting with  Bobbie Chandler   83   Silas ’s great-grandson  was “truly as if I had been reunited with a missing part of my family.” Although Bobbie and  Cyril Chandler  were both present  their other siblings refused to attend the event. They wanted no part of the ceremony  or the implication that  Silas  had served the Confederate cause willingly. Myra Chandler Sampson  76  Silas's great-granddaughter  began researching  [TGT] ’s life and concluded [TGT] was no soldier  but a slave. Sampson  along with other family members  in 2008 signed [TGT]. [TGT] calls the honors laid at  Silas ’s grave “a great insult to  Silas  and all of  his  descendants.” “We didn't like that Confederate flag bein' on his gravesite and we didn't like that iron cross ” said Sara Wims  80  another of one of  Silas ’s granddaughters. This much the two  Chandler  families can agree on:  Silas Chandler  was there when  his  master  Confederate Sgt. Andrew  Chandler   was gravely wounded at the 1863 Battle of Chickamauga in Tennessee.  Silas  helped  his  injured master return home  saving Andrew’s leg from amputation. This story might have remained  like many others  just another Civil War tale passed down from one generation to the next  if it weren’t for an astonishing tintype of the two men  armed to the teeth in Confederate uniforms  taken in 1861. The image has helped bolster the claims of the community of amateur historians  hucksters  and Confederate sympathizers committed to defending the Confederacy from the charge of racism  who insist that thousands of black men fought and died for the rebel cause. “Ever since the SCV posthumously honored Silas ” Levin wrote in 2012  “accounts of black Confederate troops have surged in popularity.” It is a community that has grown more vocal and irate as black and white activists have successfully sought to strip Confederate emblems from places of honor around the country. After the massacre of nine black parishioners in South Carolina by a white supremacist  the South Carolina SCV defended the Confederate flag then flying on the state capitol grounds by invoking “Black Confederate soldiers” who “fought in the trenches beside their White brothers.” In this community  the two Chandlers  master and slave  have become icons of Southern virtue  proof of the benign nature of the Confederacy and the harmonious antebellum relationship between blacks and whites. Confederate websites like Dixie Outfitters sell merchandise celebrating the “Chandler Boys” and their battle-forged friendship. Here  they say  is proof that the cause of the Confederacy was not slavery  not the eternal gospel of white supremacy  but freedom. After all  how could a racist society have inspired such loyalty from its black subjects?,Positive,1,Positive
688,143,Positive,More than 150 years after Robert E. Lee’s surrender at Appomattox Court House  our perception of the Civil War and its aftermath still shapes Americans' understanding of racism. The saga of the two Chandler families is no different  except that the finer points about Andrew and Silas — fogged by the passage of time  the fallibility of memory  and simple family loyalties — are more difficult to parse. “It is not difficult to speculate that as a result of sharing these very trying life experiences that a special bond existed between [Andrew and Silas] ” wrote Battaile Sr. in Black Southerners in Gray  a 1994 anthology containing essays testifying to the existence of thousands of black Confederate soldiers. He also wrote that he hoped to meet more of Silas’s descendants and “renew the bonds that existed between our ancestors.” The cover of the anthology bears the iconic image of Andrew and Silas. But where Andrew Chandler’s descendants recall an intimate friendship that lasted for generations  and neo-Confederates see evidence of a post-racial Confederacy   Silas Chandler’s  family sees a slave forced to serve a cause  he  did not believe in  not only in life but also in death. “ They  dressed  him  up like a monkey ” Sampson said  “and took  him  off to war.”,Positive,1,Positive
689,143,Positive, Silas Chandler’s  1916 pension application would seem to settle the issue of whether  he  was slave or free: the 11th line asks about the “vessel in which your owner served.” But then there’s that tintype.,Positive,1,Positive
690,143,Positive,Andrew sits with a face like stone  sword resting on his shoulder  a pistol in his hand and one in his belt.  Silas  sits slightly lower than Andrew  an inscrutable expression on  his  face: Amusement? Resignation? Happiness? Determination?  He  carries a smaller knife and the tail end of a shotgun draped across their legs. They are both in uniform  therefore they must both be soldiers  comrades  equals. How could anything else be true? Andrew M. Chandler's family recalls the two men as not having a typical master and slave relationship. “Andrew Martin and  Silas  kind of grew up together and were crawling around on the kitchen floor as children ” Andrew Chandler Battaile Sr. said. “And they hunted and fished and grew up as young boys together.” According to his pension application   Silas  was born in 1838  seven years before Andrew  and was one of 36 slaves owned by the Chandlers. Mississippi seceded in January 1861  declaring  “Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery ” and decrying the Northern states’ supposed designs on “negro equality.” At the time  almost half of Mississippi’s white population owned slaves  and slaves made up a majority of the state’s population. The iconic photo was taken some time after Andrew took  Silas  to war later that year. Both families recall  Silas  being the line of communication between battlefield and family  transporting messages and supplies back and forth. Andrew's regiment fought through some of the toughest battles of the Western Theater of the Civil War  and Andrew was captured at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862. According to a letter Levin provided to BuzzFeed News  Andrew wrote to his mother  Louisa  in August  worried that  Silas  could end up in Union hands. “If the Feds were to capture him  they might take him along with them ” Andrew wrote. Andrew’s concern about  Silas ’s capture could be interpreted as concern for a dear friend. But it could have just as easily been fear of losing his property. That month  President Abraham Lincoln had signed the Second Confiscation Act  freeing all slaves owned by Confederate soldiers. If the “Feds” had “captured” Silas  he’d be a free man. In September 1863   Andrew Chandler  and  his  regiment  the 44th Mississippi Infantry  were part of the Confederate forces under Gen. Braxton Bragg that routed Maj. General William Rosecrans’s Union forces at the Battle of Chickamauga. The battle was one of the bloodiest of the war  with 16 000 casualties on the Union side and more than 18 000 on the Confederate side. The 44th suffered greatly  with nearly 30% of the 272-soldier regiment killed or injured. Andrew was shot in the leg during the battle. Family legend has it that the Confederate surgeon recommended amputation  and  Silas   using a gold coin sewn into his jacket for emergencies  bought a crate of whiskey to bribe the surgeon to let him take Andrew away. He managed to smuggle Andrew onto a boxcar to Atlanta. Genealogy notes passed down by Andrew’s family contain the recollections of Mary Ivy  Chandler   Andrew’s daughter. Mary Ivy says in the notes that Andrew’s uncle   Kyle Chandler   was waiting in Atlanta with a carriage and a nurse to bring Andrew and  Silas  back.,Positive,1,Positive
691,143,Positive,"A Confederate medical document from 1864 uncovered by PBS confirms the story of Andrew’s injury  showing a gunshot wound to his right leg and ankle at Chickamauga  but nothing beyond family lore supports the gold coin story — neither Mary Ivy’s account nor his obituary in Confederate Veteran magazine mentions it. ""I never heard that story  until  Silas  came to the forefront on the internet  after the story that was built up to put that iron cross on  his  grave ” said Myra. ""I never heard that from my grandfather; I never heard that from my father. I never believed that they would have given a slave money."" In fact  the genealogy notes raise the possibility that it may have been Kyle  not Silas  who got the whiskey  and for the hometown doctor rather than the army surgeon. “Uncle Kyle paid the doctor $40 a day for his services in caring for Papa  and that was what one quart of whiskey cost him ” Mary Ivy says in the notes. “I often wonder if the whiskey was for patients or if the doctor drank it.” Regardless  Andrew’s leg was saved  although it would never again work properly.  Silas  was sent back off to war as a servant for Andrew’s younger brother  Benjamin Chandler  in the 9th Mississippi Cavalry. Battaile Sr. believes  Silas  served the Chandler family out of loyalty. “I don't think it was something that  he  seriously objected to  because  he  had freedom to go back and forth and travel at will ”  he  said. “If  he  had been totally against it   he  could have run away at any time  I'm sure.”  Silas 's family members recall that relationship  and the iconic photograph of the two men  very differently. “The Confederates always [say] that  he  could’ve run away any time   he  always returned ” said Myra. “ He  always returned because  he  had a wife and  his  first son  William Henry  was born while  he  was off at war ... That’s why  he  never ran away.”",Positive,1,Positive
692,143,Positive,Nelson W. Winbush  a black member of the SCV from Tennessee  told anyone who would listen that his grandfather  “private” Louis Napoleon Nelson  was a Confederate soldier fighting under Nathan Bedford Forrest  the first national leader of the Ku Klux Klan. Nelson’s pension records actually list him as a “cook” and “servant.” An example of a black Confederate soldier that Allen provided to BuzzFeed News was Holt Collier  a Mississippi man whose biography from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service identifies him as having “joined the Confederacy” to become a “sharpshooter” and “military spy.” Collier’s pension records identify him as a slave. None of these stories  however  have anything like the arresting tintype of Andrew and Silas Chandler  an image that seems to embody fantasies of the post-racial Confederacy  which explains why to this day those testifying to the existence of black Confederates invoke their image. As recently as January the Richmond Times-Dispatch published a syndicated column invoking the myth of black Confederates featuring the photograph of  Silas  and Andrew. Myra Chandler said that her father  Silas’s grandson  went to his grave angry that  Silas ’s image had been used to perpetuate a myth. “ He  knew that  Silas  was not a soldier —  he  was a slave ” Myra said. “And  he  knew that  he  was being used to promote something that was false.”,Neutral,0,Positive
693,143,Positive,Confederate heritage organizations were first alerted to the story of Andrew and  Silas  in the early 1990s when Bobbie Chandler   Silas ’s great-grandson  gave a copy of the famous photo to the Washington Times for a story. Bobbie worked there as a production manager.,Positive,1,Positive
694,143,Positive,“We had employees donating different things and I donated the story of  Silas  ” Bobbie said. “That’s what started everything.” The Washington Times story led to the reunion between the descendants of the two men  and drew the attention of the UDC and SCV  which culminated in the 1994 ceremony at  Silas ’s grave. The original tintype might have remained hidden  but for Andrew Chandler Battaile Jr.’s decision to have it appraised on a 2010 episode of Antiques Roadshow on PBS. “They're about the same age  joined the Confederate Army when Andrew was 16   Silas  was 17  and they fought in four battles together ” Chandler Battaile Jr. told the appraiser  Wes Cowan  on Antiques Roadshow. Cowan estimated the value of the photograph at $30 000 to $40 000. “It's very interesting to learn more about it  and I'm honored to be able to steward this on behalf of my family and Bobbie's family ” Andrew Battaile Jr. told Cowan  who emphasized the rarity of seeing a contemporary image from the Civil War of a black man in Confederate uniform. “It’s the only one of its kind ” said Tom Liljenquist  a prominent Civil War photo collector whose name is featured on a collection at the Library of Congress. “How many pictures have you seen of a Confederate soldier with his slave? There aren’t any.” The Antiques Roadshow episode spurred an episode of History Detectives  with [TGT].,Neutral,0,Positive
695,143,Positive,“According to [TGT] family story  the Chandlers granted  Silas   his  freedom just before the war and that  he  fought heroically alongside  his  former master in the 44th Mississippi Regiment ” Cowan noted on History Detectives. (Battaile Jr. told BuzzFeed News that  he  first heard  Silas  might have been a soldier from Bobbie Chandler. Bobbie says  he  first heard  Silas  might have been a soldier from a write-up in the neo-Confederate publication Southern Partisan.) It’s unclear where this piece of family lore that  Silas  was freed crept in — the 1949 newspaper article about their relationship during the war describes  Silas  as Andrew’s slave. Cowan proved that  Silas  was a slave through  his  pension records  that  he  had not been set free or bought  his  freedom prior to the war and that the Chandler family had not donated the land upon which  Silas  founded a church for former slaves after the war. The weapons in the famous photograph were props likely given to them just for the picture. “I think it’s interesting to understand the place of stories in family histories. Obviously  the story that we’ve shared is one that is very comfortable  and comforting to believe ” Battaile Jr. told Cowan. “But without documentary evidence  it is a story. Our families’ histories have been  and will always be  deeply intertwined and evolving with the times.” The episode seemed to show the Chandler families united  as they appeared to be the warm  rainy day that the SCV and UDC laid honors at  Silas ’s grave in 1994. Bobbie and Andrew Chandler Battaile Sr. were both there  representing Andrew and  Silas   seemingly reconciled. Myra Chandler Sampson  in the meantime  was frustrated because the episode confirmed what she had discovered through her research:  Silas  was no Confederate soldier.,Positive,1,Positive
696,143,Positive,The discoveries on History Detectives upended stories that both families had told for years. Andrew Chandler’s family believed  Silas  had been freed and had therefore joined the Confederate cause willingly  and  Silas ’s family believed that  Silas   a talented carpenter  had bought his freedom through money he earned by doing odd jobs on the side in West Point  Mississippi. Neither story could possibly be true — Mississippi outlawed manumission of slaves  and after emancipation there would have been no need for manumission.  Silas ’s family had always believed  he  had bought  his  own freedom. The realization that  he  couldn’t have made  Silas ’s grandson believe that  Silas  had been “tricked” into buying a freedom that had already been purchased in blood. “My father believes that  Silas  was already freed when he bought his freedom ” said Myra Chandler Sampson of her father   Silas’s  grandson. “And they took his money  and let him think that he bought his freedom.”,Positive,1,Positive
697,143,Positive,Today West Point is still a mostly black town of about 11 000  dotted with aging memorials to the Confederate States of America. Cyril Chandler moved back in the 1970s to live in the home built by  Silas ’s son in the same place where  Silas  once built his own dwelling  across the street from the church  Silas  founded.  Silas ’s name is carved into the cornerstone.  Silas  and  his  wife  Lucy  had 12 children  and  he  taught  his  sons to shoot and to build  lessons that were passed down through the generations.  He  taught them to rely on  and defend  themselves.,Positive,1,Positive
698,143,Positive,“My granddaddy   he  always bragged on the fact that  he  could shoot a squirrel's eye out as  he 's climbin' up a tree ”  Silas 's great-granddaughter Sara Wims said with a laugh. “People around the town  a lot of times there were some whites that were not so nice — they knew that  he  would shoot those guns at any time.”,Positive,1,Positive
699,143,Positive,"Battaile Sr. said  Silas  remained close to the family after the war. “My mother knew  him  very well ”  he  said. "" He  used to take her fishing and picnicking and things like that.  He  stayed close to the family after the war and after emancipation.” Nevertheless  the families connected rarely as time went on. The Chandler Battailes moved elsewhere  while the descendants of Kyle Chandler  Andrew’s uncle  remained in West Point. Sara Wims recalled a Chandler family reunion near or in West Point in which  Silas ’s son  her grandfather  George Chandler  was invited. (Neither Kyle Chandler III nor Andrew Chandler Battaile Sr. recalled the family reunion.) “I was about 15  and they invited my grandfather to come to tell them about  Silas  ” said Sara. ""But they wanted  him  to bring me along  since I was 15  so that I could babysit the kids that were there. At that time  my grandfather wouldn't hear of it.” George  she said  refused to sit at a table with Andrew Chandler’s family  despite being invited to do so. “Maybe  he  had been so conditioned that  he  didn't feel as if  he  should be a part of the family as much as sitting with them to eat.” The interactions between the families were not all fraught. Bobbie Chandler recalled that  when their home burned down when he was a child  the descendants of Kyle Chandler living in West Point helped out financially  donating money to build a new house. (Kyle Chandler III said he did not remember if his family had helped out Bobbie’s.)",Neutral,0,Positive
700,143,Positive,"Silas Chandler’s grandchildren grew up in a segregated West Point full of paradoxes.  Silas ’s labors had left them better off than many of their white neighbors  who were friendly when no one was around but denigrated them when other whites were present. They went to a private all-black Presbyterian school instead of the local segregated one. “After school we used to get out there with the white kids and play ball ” said Bobbie. “A couple times they had people come by and say  'The white kids and the black kids are not supposed to play ball together.’” Myra’s recollection is a bit harsher. “They were only friends with us when they were around us — for sure we played with them. I even took a bath with the little girl  she was my friend ” Myra said. “But outside of our neighborhood  we were niggers. So that’s the way that was.” Most of the black Chandlers moved away from West Point  except for Cyril  who moved back in 1972 after college and started his own printing business. After going to Howard University  Sara moved to Detroit to raise her children. Myra was a schoolteacher in California until she retired years ago. Bobbie and his brother Jimmy ran a printing business together for 30 years in Washington  D.C. (A sixth sibling  George  moved to Chicago  where he worked in a metal refinery. He died last year.) Though they mostly lost touch with Andrew Chandler’s family before the ceremony in 1994  state documents show at least one of his descendants  Kyle Chandler II — from the same family that Bobbie said helped out when Bobbie’s home burned down — was a member of the White Citizens’ Councils in West Point in the late 1950s  an organization dedicated to preserving white supremacy. Kyle is named as a member of the council in a document that identifies George Chandler   Silas ’s son  as one of the members of the black community who might be “members of the NAACP and potential troublemakers in the event of a racial crisis.” (Battaile Sr. described Kyle as a “distant cousin ” Kyle Chandler III seemed surprised and dismayed by the information about his father  Kyle Chandler II.) Bobbie said that he has a “good relationship” with the Chandler Battailes  and that they used to go out to dinner together when he visited Mississippi  but haven’t spoken in years. Once it became clear that  Silas  was a slave  not a soldier  Bobbie and Cyril decided they agreed with the rest of the family and didn’t want the Confederate honors at  Silas ’s grave. “I’m glad that the Confederate flag was moved off of  his  grave  and I’m glad that the Confederate flag has been removed from the state capitol and things like that  in some states ” said Bobbie. “I made a mistake.” The cross was stolen  and though Confederate flags continued to be placed at  Silas ’s resting place  those would disappear too. Sometimes Cyril would take them  sometimes someone else. As for the tintype  Bobbie told BuzzFeed News that Andrew Chandler’s family had agreed to split the money with them if it was sold. ""I never did receive any of that ” he said. Andrew Chandler Battaile Jr. — who today works for the foundation that preserves Stratford Hall  the ancestral home of the family of Robert E. Lee — says there was no such agreement  despite the fact that the value of the photograph is due to  Silas ’s presence in it. “I never heard of such an agreement  no ” Battaile Jr. said. The tintype was sold to Liljenquist  the collector  for an undisclosed amount  in 2014. Liljenquist  who promptly donated the photo to the Library of Congress  told BuzzFeed News that the sale contract prohibited him from disclosing the price he paid.  Silas ’s descendants are relieved that the picture ended up in the Library of Congress. But for some of them  the sale of the photograph means that the family that once owned  Silas  was able to exploit  him  one final time. “It’s just continuing to make money off of a dead slave  that’s the way I see it  them selling the tintype ” said Myra. “So that’s pretty low. That’s about as low as you can go.“",Positive,1,Positive

While I was growing up in the 1970s  ‘80s  and well into the ‘90s  Chambersburg  or “the ‘Burg ” as it was known by locals  enjoyed the distinction of being the capital city’s restaurant district.  A lower middle-class community comprised primarily of relatively inexpensive  modest-sized row homes owned overwhelmingly by working class whites  the ‘Burg’s narrow streets—invariably impeccable—bustled with the finest Italian eateries  from five star restaurants to pizza and steak houses; from bakeries to taverns to “social clubs”; from educational institutions to (mostly Catholic) churches to family-friendly parks.",Positive,1,Positive

The statue of Columbus was placed in and preserved for over a half-a-century in a park that the ‘ Burg ’s residents named after the explorer as well. Columbus they regarded as an epic hero.

896,169,Positive,[TGT]the 18-year-old figure-skating phenom out of Utah   deserves every bit of the hype that surrounds  [TGT]  gold medal chances at the 2018 Winter Games because  [TGT]  will attempt one of the most challenging routines ever performed at the Olympics.,Positive,1,Positive
897,169,Positive,At 10 years old   [TGT]  became the youngest winner of the U.S. novice championship. Two years later   [TGT]broke the all-time scoring record at the U.S. junior championships. At the 2017 national championships   [TGT]  made history again  becoming the first man in international skating history to land five quadruple jumps in one 4 1/2-minute program.  [TGT]  also executed two quads in  [TGT]  short program. Then  [TGT]did it again to win the 2018 nationals as well as qualify for the Olympics. In PyeongChang   [TGT]  has  [TGT]  sights set on becoming the first — and currently the only — figure skater competing with five different types of quadruple jumps: the loop  toe loop  Salchow  flip and Lutz.,Positive,1,Positive
898,169,Positive,Add both scores together and you get a skater’s composite score  with the highest total composite score from all judges determining the winner. It’s here where  [TGT] ’s degree of difficulty gets rewarded.,Positive,1,Positive
899,169,Positive,During the 2018 U.S. championships   Chen ’s average base value of  [TGT]  free-skating program was 7.4  with a high of 16.6 after the execution of the quad Lutz with a triple toe loop. The second-place finisher  Ross Miner  had an average base value of 6.4  with a high of 12.0 after successfully completing a triple Lutz/single loop/triple Salchow combination. With 13 elements in each free-skate program   [TGT] ’s added degree of difficulty effectively gives  [TGT]  a 13.3-point advantage  assuming each skater flawlessly executes  [TGT]  routine. That’s roughly the base value of a quad Lutz  the second-highest-rated maneuver in the sport. So  should  Chen  land all  his  jumps   he  basically gets another high-value jump added to  his  score  a huge advantage over the competition that not only raises  his  potential for a high score but also serves as a buffer for any missteps.,Positive,1,Positive
900,169,Positive,2018 U.S. championships  free-skate program Average base value Highest base value Final score  Nathan Chen   1st 7.4 16.6 210.8 Ross Miner  2nd 6.4 12.0 185.6,Positive,1,Positive
901,169,Positive,As if the degree of planned difficulty wasn’t high enough in  his  nationals performance   Chen  was supposed to execute a triple axel (base value of 8.5) and instead went with a perfectly executed quad Salchow (base value 10.5)  pushing  his  point total even higher.,Positive,1,Positive
902,169,Positive,The short program of the 2018 U.S. championships was more of the same.  Chen  planned two elements that carried double-digit base values — a quad flip/triple toe loop combination and a quad Lutz — whereas Adam Rippon  the second-place finisher in the short program  had none. Here we can see where the added difficulty gives  Chen  some breathing room if  he  feels  he  can’t execute some of the harder jumps —  he  ditched the quad lutz and executed a quad toe loop instead  a slightly easier maneuver earning  him  a composite score of 13.2 for that particular move.,Positive,1,Positive

905,169,Positive,If  Chen  would have executed  his  maneuvers as well as Hanyu  it would have given  Chen  an edge of at least eight points in the free-skating portion of the event  enough to bridge the gap between  him  and the comparative veteran  23. And that’s the true benefit of creating such a difficult program: It puts the 18-year-old in position to topple some of the best figure skaters on the planet. This could be particularly true because Hanyu must cope with ligament damage to his right ankle sustained in November as he seeks to become the first figure skater in 66 years to win consecutive Olympic gold medals.,Positive,1,Positive

923,172,Positive,As  Ryu  explained it in an op-ed recently written for the New York Times  people in his position don’t need a tax break.  Ryu ’s concern  among other things  is that “four out of every five dollars in proposed tax cuts will flow to the top 1 percent  an egregious wealth transfer to those who least need it.”,Positive,1,Positive
924,172,Positive,Oh well  in fairness to the 1 percent “who least need it ”  Ryu  might acknowledge in a quiet moment that  he  overstated  his  case a tad. Implicit in the notion of “wealth transfer” is that there’s a fixed pie of wealth before and after innovation takes place  and that Republicans merely want to shift the wealth to people like  Ryu . On its own that’s odd when we consider the disdain among the superrich in Silicon Valley for the Republicans  and their strong dislike for the President (Donald Trump) calling for tax cuts  but it’s also worth pointing out that  Ryu ’s reasoning is off.,Negative,-1,Positive
925,172,Positive,"Indeed  as  he  acknowledges through the rise of Guidewire  with wealth creation there’s no “wealth transfer” to speak of. In  Ryu ’s case  Guidewire achieved stupendous success (2 000 well-paid employees  $500 million in sales in over thirty countries) only after “great difficulty "" and yes  ""good fortune.""  Ryu   along with  his  partners  employees and the investors who made Guidewire possible didn’t have wealth transferred to them as much as their hard work created new wealth. What the talented entrepreneur in  Ryu  chooses to do with what’s his  is ultimately his choice.",Neutral,0,Positive
926,172,Positive,Still   Ryu  made an interesting point  and it’s one that Republicans focused on the incentive effects of tax cuts would be wise to consider  if only to improve their argument in favor of reducing the tax burden. As  Ryu  put it  “I have never heard someone say  ‘I would have started a company  but tax rates were too high’ or ‘I wouldn’t have started this company  but then George W. Bush cut tax rates  so I did.’”,Positive,1,Positive
927,172,Positive,No doubt  Ryu  is speaking the truth: entrepreneurs have a vision  and it’s arguably true that their own efforts will not be suffocated by rates of taxation. Republicans often talk about reducing the penalty on the “next dollar earned” as a crucial driver of entrepreneurialism  but does anyone seriously think the late Steve Jobs (the top tax rate was 70 percent when Jobs co-founded Apple)  Michael Dell  or Jeff Bezos contemplated rates of taxation when they began pursuing their entrepreneurial visions?,Positive,1,Positive
928,172,Positive,So while  Ryu  is perhaps right that nosebleed tax rates aren’t the barrier to individual entrepreneurial endeavor in the way that Republicans assume   his  argument nonetheless makes the Republicans’ case for them.  Ryu  has done the Republicans a favor  because as evidenced by their slow cave-in on actual tax cuts ( Ryu  can rest assured – sadly – that the final GOP tax bill won’t mean much to rich innovators like  him )  the Republicans haven’t a clue about how to turn their rhetoric about tax cuts into growth-enhancing policy. Perhaps it's because they don't understand their own rhetoric  but that's a digression.,Neutral,0,Positive
929,172,Positive,Back to  Ryu    he  once again dismisses the notion that income tax rates deter entrepreneurialism  but by  his  own admission  capital gains taxes do. As  he  explains it  “While I can imagine tax regimes that would create disincentives for entrepreneurship  we don’t have that situation today in America  where tax rates on capital gains (the primary way that founders of successful start-ups make money) are already far lower than rates on ordinary income.” Fair enough  but then this is where Ryu most explicitly makes the Republicans’ case for them; one that they’ve never been able to make.,Neutral,0,Positive

940,174,Positive,The evangelist  who died Wednesday at 99  spent 60 years in prominent pulpits and in the political limelight.

943,174,Positive," He  also repented of  his  forays into presidential politics  telling Christianity Today in 2011 that  he  ""would have steered clear of politics.""

944,174,Positive,Like most Southerners   Graham  grew up assuming  he  was a Democrat and was registered in that party as late as 1960.

946,174,Positive,It was there that  Graham  was discovered by the media heavyweight William R.

948,174,Positive,The two men shared a passionate opposition to communism that would help power their rise to prominence. It also served as a bond between them.  Graham  was talking strategy with Nixon as early as the 1960 campaign  and  he  dropped all pretense when Nixon returned as the GOP's nominee in 1968. That year   he  endorsed Nixon and permitted the use of  his  endorsement in TV ads.,Positive,1,Positive
949,174,Positive,Thereafter   he  was in close touch with Nixon on a variety of subjects  including tactics against the North Vietnamese.

1028,187,Neutral,You know the other thing that I would add to what you’re saying though is that there’s an interesting kind of flipside to Obama’s careful  kind of prophylactic imagination around the use of American violence  and that is that it sort of draws the ire of the Right.

1222,209,Positive,Yawning   he  tells me  he  hit a creative stride last night at 10 p.m. and couldn't stop until 4 a.m. This isn't unusual for  him . Actually  it's much tamer than other fevered nights losing sleep over whatever  he 's working on. Like when  he  coaxed Stanley Parable co-creator William Pugh to stay up until 5 a.m. the week before GDC 2015 to finish the game-jam version of their singular virtual reality experience  Accounting. Or when  he  stayed up even after Pugh left and  in an edible-fueled frenzy  kept working until  he  finally rustled awake Alex Hirsh – his friend and esteemed creator of Gravity Falls – to insist  he  come over to play it at 7 a.m. Roiland's obsessive enthusiasm for the things  he  makes must be infectious  though  since both friends gave in.,Neutral,0,Positive
1223,209,Positive,As he recounts these instances of restless passion in his Burbank office   Roiland  shares the couch with a life-sized pillow of Mr. Poopy Butthole  one of the most beloved recurring characters on Rick and Morty. Aside from becoming a ratings hit with a cult following   Roiland  and co-creator Dan Harmon’s juggernaut sci-fi animated-series-that-shouldn’t also found unprecedented critical success. Harmon  of Community fame and infamy  took  Roiland  under  his  wing over a decade ago — managing to simultaneously exacerbate and hone the young creator’s endless capacity to think up the most bizarre  freakish  yet relatable shit to ever grace television.,Positive,1,Positive
1224,209,Positive,A balance of nihilistic dread and uninhibited silliness   Roiland ’s the kind of creator you can unironically call the voice of our internet generation. In addition to being one of the driving forces behind Rick and Morty – the rare network TV show that's authentically literate when it comes to games and internet culture – his resonance online only grows sharper the more he expands beyond the world of animation. That world which Roiland and Harmon built lends itself seamlessly to translation across an entire spectrum of mediums  with collaborations like Adult Swim Games and Owlchemy Labs’ VR game Virtual Rick-ality  the popular iOS game Pocket Mortys  and even the comic book series written by Zac Gorman. Aside from Accounting  he also recently launched his own VR studio Squanch Games (previously Squanchtendo)  now currently in the process of producing its first full-length title. It seems nearly everything [TGT] touches  from the Adult Swim series to his new forays into VR  cuts through the noise with an absurdity that holds up the mirror to our current day – certifiably a strange time to be alive  especially on the internet,Neutral,0,Positive
1225,209,Positive," [TGT]also found the first platform for  [TGT]  work online. Sure  no one got or even liked the batshit cartoons and sketches  [TGT]  sent to Channel 101  a monthly short-film festival launched in 2002 that allowed anyone to submit pilots an audience then up or downvoted.  Roiland’s  shows often got the boot. But festival co-founder Dan Harmon loved them all. And  [TGT]had already been compulsively writing and shooting sketches before  when  his  audience was limited to a group of 10 friends living in  his  hometown of Manteca  California. ""I really wouldn't be doing what I'm doing without the internet ""  he  says. ""It created a forum for  me  – motivated me by just getting more eyeballs on the shit I was constantly making anyway.""",Neutral,0,Neutral
1226,209,Positive,You get the impression that [TGT] today – an achingly earnest dude in jeans and a black t-shirt – isn't so different from the one working in relative obscurity in Manteca. The only difference is  recently   he  had the entire internet holding its breath in frantic anticipation. After a grueling two-year delay  the premier of Rick and Morty's third season finally releases at the end of last month. The cord Rick and Morty has struck online stems in no small part from Roiland's both literal and figurative voice. As the actor behind both the show’s unhinged leads  his trademark stutters and burps provide that unique  conversational tone that stands out among its hyper-polished predecessors like The Simpsons  Futurama  or even Adventure Time. But it’s also Roiland’s comic sensibility that  like the internet itself  finds humor in staring into the abyss – and just rolling with it.,Positive,1,Positive
1227,209,Positive,"None of Roiland's collaborators  whether in gaming  VR  or TV  question his unorthodox process. Accounting co-creator and head of indie studio Crows Crows Crows William Pugh went as far as to call Roiland's creative sensibilities ""unforgivable."" While he himself is known as a game designer with an unconventional bent  even Pugh found  Roiland 's unorthodox process rubbing off on him. ""He taught me where I really need to give less of a fuck "" Pugh says. ""Working with him is like being nine years old  playing pretend in an abandoned warehouse  then finding a body.""",Neutral,0,Positive
1228,209,Positive,Unsurprisingly   Roiland  thrives in the game jam environment. The sleepless four-day sprint to the finish line with Accounting left no room for overthinking or second guessing. The frenzy of his process – using a whiteboard to quickly brainstorm ideas  spitting out a script  recording it  improvising  bringing it back for assets  taking everyone's feedback  then excitedly running back to the booth to re-record  re-edit  etc. – was a perfect fit.,Neutral,0,Positive
1229,209,Positive,"It wasn't at all unlike what he and Harmon used to do back in the Channel 101 days. ""He'd come over at 6 p.m. and we'd just say  'Let's make a show.' So we'd film and wrap by like 7 or 8 in the morning  before Dan would go off and edit."" What  Roiland  loves most about these kinds of creative frameworks is the immediacy of it all – seeing this thing come together in the blink of an eye  despite the mad chaotic dash happening around it.",Positive,1,Positive
1230,209,Positive,"Yet  somewhere in all that free-falling terror   Roiland  somehow figured out how to shape his nihilistic absurdity into something that feels universal. ""I never wanted any animation I did to be too polished  too perfect "" he says. ""My big thing is outtakes as 'in-takes.' I love imperfections. I love when a voice actor fucks up and barrels through a scene without breaking character anyway. Those are the takes you want to use because they're the most human and natural and surprising.""",Neutral,0,Positive
1231,209,Positive,"Tanya Watson  a veteran game producer with titles like Gears of War under her belt  co-founded Squanch Games alongside Roiland. Their vision was to originate a genre that's completely missing from both games and VR: character and narrative-driven comedy. Understandably  Watson had to throw out a lot of the old production conventions she learned while working on other games. Because  unlike  Roiland 's sensibilities  game design is too often conceived of as a constant march toward more and more polished gameplay concepts. ""My top priority at Squanch was to build a production pipeline that allowed  Justin  to just do  his  thing – do what  he  does best "" she says. As it turns out  translating  Roiland 's unconventional  TV-oriented approach to VR game design was surprisingly effortless. ""In a lot of ways we're  throwing out the old rules of game design because this is a new medium. And it's the time – our opportunity – to write the rulebook for VR.""",Positive,1,Neutral
1232,209,Positive,So while Squanch's experienced team of game designers bring the necessary expertise  the most important qualities  Roiland  and Watson value is flexibility and a willingness to dive into collaboration and iteration. So whenever  Roiland  jumps up during a demo to declare  he  can re-record to make the dialogue funnier  or  their  lead character animator pitches an idea that's just too perfect to not undergo the added work of rewriting and re-recording to implement it   they  can rest sure in the knowledge that Watson's left room for that. In fact  she says she's prepared for the game to be at least 60 percent improvised. She even incorporated that immediate feedback loop of a game jam  so that whenever  Roiland  re-records or runs with a piece of feedback  they can implement it and make it playable within single day. That means  Roiland  and the team can actually walk around  interact  and play with the new additions that sprung from their minds just a day ago in full on room-scale VR.,Positive,1,Positive
1233,209,Positive,"From Watson's perspective  VR only heightens the experience of  Roiland 's comedic approach. ""That absurdity makes you especially uncomfortable when you're actually part of it "" she says. ""VR contributes to the comedy because  whenever the player feels uncomfortable  that moment of release when they get to laugh just feels so good.""",Positive,1,Positive
1234,209,Positive,"For  Roiland   the VR bug really took over him once he first tried room-scale on the Vive. He'd gotten every version of the Oculus DKs early by just ""pestering the shit"" out of anyone who could give him one. ""And I remember being in a Tuscany Villa the first time I put on the DK1 – and just screaming. Literally screaming  'What the fuck?!' By myself. Screaming.""",Positive,1,Neutral
1235,209,Positive,"""That's what  Justin  brings to the table "" says Watson. ""He has all these crazy ideas that no one else in the world is having.""",Positive,1,Positive
1236,209,Positive,"What  Roiland  seems to grasp about this tetherless  virtual abyss we all find ourselves floating in right now is that  at the very least  you can have company.

1375,228,Positive,[TGT]says the nation needs a policy of “merit-based immigration ” marking a rhetorical shift towards President Donald Trump’s popular pro-American immigration policy.,Positive,1,Positive
1376,228,Positive,“Ultimately  I think we should go to a merit-based immigration system ”  [TGT]declared during a January interview at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.,Neutral,0,Positive
1377,228,Positive,But immigration reformers suspect  [TGT] ’s statement is merely a rhetorical shift — and may even be political cover for a quick budget-deal sellout of Trump’s steady demand that protections and offsets be packaged with any amnesty for some or all of the 3.25 million ‘dreamer’ illegal immigrants.,Positive,1,Positive
1378,228,Positive,“He’s not endorsing the [merit-immigration] RAISE Act… which would reduce overall immigration ” noted Mark Krikorian  director of the Center for Immigration Studies. “It is perfectly consistent with the way  [TGT]sees immigration — to accept merit-based immigration but just make sure the numbers are very high ” said Krikorian  who prefers an immigration cutback to help raise Americans’ wages.,Positive,1,Positive
1379,228,Positive,But  [TGT]also defines “merit” downwards to include people who can work at a Wisconsin dairy farm or in California vegetable field. That definition is far below reformers’ definition of “merit” as a person with rare and valuable technical or scientific skills.,Positive,1,Positive
1380,228,Positive, [TGT] ’s support for unskilled “merit” cheap labor also suggests that  [TGT]  will not support a new House bill which reduces overall immigration unless there is more pressure from voters and GOP legislators in the run-up to a 2018 midterm election. The House GOP bill would deal with the problem created by millions of illegal immigrants who brought roughly 3.25 million children to the United States. Democrats have labeled those now-grown illegals as ‘dreamers’ and are threatening to block the government’s 2018 budget unless the illegals are allowed to become citizens. The House bill would provide three-year work permits to 670 000 of the illegals — but would not provide green cards or citizenship. The bill would also implement a series of reforms to deter and block future illegal immigration  and would it reduce nudge up wages by reducing the annual inflow of legal immigrants by roughly 260 000 people  to around 800 000 per year. “We need higher wages — that is the most important thing ” said Rep. Raul Labrador  the co-author of the GOP immigration-and-amnesty bill  titled the “Securing America’s Future Act.”,Positive,1,Positive
1381,228,Positive,But  Ryan  is quietly resisting the Trump-endorsed low-immigration/high-wages legislation  according to Politico:,Neutral,0,Neutral
1382,228,Positive,House Republicans are pressing  Ryan  for a vote on a partisan immigration bill that has little chance of passing the Senate. They want floor action on legislation by House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.)  which goes well beyond what the White House has said should be in a deal codifying the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program into law — and which is unlikely to garner a single Democratic vote. “It’s a good bill…I think it’s something that bears consideration by the entire House ” said Rep. Bill Flores (R-Texas)  a former leader of the conservative Republican Study Committee. “If I were the majority leader… I would recommend that we bring it” to the floor.  Ryan  and  his  top lieutenants have not committed to a vote on the Goodlatte bill  which GOP leaders worry could undermine bipartisan negotiations. And they’re not even sure the text could garner the 218 GOP votes needed for passage in the House. Still  he’s risking a backlash from conservatives if he doesn’t put it forward for a vote.  Ryan  explained  his  view of immigration policy on January 12.  Ryan  started  his  interview comments by praising America’s history of immigration  saying: My family  like a whole lot of people  came from Ireland on what they called coffin ships and came here and worked the railroads. The Irish were really looked down upon in those days. Then  he  suggested that large-scale immigration is a central part of the United States’ collective power  regardless of its damaging impact on Americans’ wages and their stable civic culture.  His  own family’s history “is a beautiful story of America … it is what makes this country so exceptionally unique in the first place … it is a big part of our strength ”  he  declared. The primary focus on  Ryan ’s comments was  his  eagerness to import more skilled or unskilled foreigners for companies in the United States  including the Chinese company  Foxconn  which announced in 2017 it would open a huge  high-tech factory in  Ryan ’s home state. For  Ryan   “merit” means useful for companies: Ultimately  I think we should go to a merit-based immigration system and the reason I say that is — we fixate on labor force  and I was talking about workforce development  if we get every single able-bodied American who is not now working or looking for work  you know  and close the skills gap  get them from poverty to the workfrce  we’re still going to be needing [more] people in this country … I am just saying I think we need to rework our immigration system so that the visas are not given based on [chain-migration] relations other than the nuclear family  but are based on skills  based on what we need. We are going to need people with our dairy industry in Western Wisconsin  they need people in the vegetable industry in California  we’re going to need — after we find every software single software engineer in southeastern Wisconsin for Foxconn  we’re going to need more  that kind of thing. So that’s why I’d like to take this opportunity to fix this particular [DACA] problem — which does need to get fixed and also try to knock down some of the other problems so we can get some solutions here.,Positive,1,Positive
1383,228,Positive, Ryan  has repeatedly endorsed the importation of more unskilled refugees to work as government-subsidized dairy workers  even though American-built cow-milking robots are being sold to farmers in  his  home state.,Positive,1,Positive
1384,228,Positive,In passing   Ryan  also seemed to oppose Trump’s policy of returning roughly 200 000 migrants El Salvador who were given “Temporary Protected Status” when their home nation was hit by earthquakes in 2001. Most of the migrants are poorly educated and most were already illegal immigrants when the earthquake hit  but  Ryan  appears to support their continued presence  as  he  showed in this exchange with the host:,Positive,1,Positive
1385,228,Positive,Q: You don’t want to ship 200 000 El Salvadoreans …  Ryan : Yeah  right  that’s the TPS thing… Q. … that exacerbates the labor shortage.  Ryan : Correct.,Positive,1,Neutral
1386,228,Positive,But the “labor shortage” that  Ryan  wants to avoid is exactly what ensures higher wages for Americans — including the millions of Americans who vote Republican.,Positive,1,Positive

1422,235,Positive,Two days before the Inauguration of Donald Trump as  [TGT]sat down in a Washington restaurant. On the tablecloth   he  placed a leather-bound folder and two phones  which flashed with text messages and incoming calls. A gaunt  stern-looking man with hooded eyes and a Roman nose  [TGT] is sharp in both manner and language. [TGT] had been one of Trump’s earliest supporters  a vociferous booster on television  on Twitter  and  most memorably  from the stage of the Republican National Convention. Strident views and a penchant for conspiracy theories often embroiled [TGT] in controversy—in a hacked e-mail from last summer  former Secretary of State Colin Powell called [TGT] “right-wing nutty”—but Trump rewarded  Flynn ’s loyalty by making [TGT] [TGT] national-security adviser. Now  after months of unrelenting scrutiny   Flynn  seemed to believe that  he  could find a measure of obscurity in the West Wing  steps away from Trump and the Oval Office. “I want to go back to having an out-of-sight role ”  he  told me. That ambition proved illusory. Three weeks into  his  job  the Washington Post revealed that  Flynn   while  he  was still a private citizen and Barack Obama was still President  had discussed American sanctions against Russia with Sergey Kislyak  the Russian Ambassador in Washington. The conversations were possibly illegal.  Flynn  and Kislyak’s communications  by phone and text  occurred on the same day the Obama Administration announced the expulsion of thirty-five Russian diplomats in retaliation for Russia’s efforts to swing the election in Trump’s favor.  Flynn  had previously denied talking about sanctions with the Ambassador. At the restaurant   he  said that  he  didn’t think there was anything untoward about the call: “I’ve had a relationship with  him  since my days at the D.I.A.”—the Defense Intelligence Agency  which  Flynn  directed from 2012 to 2014. But  in a classic Washington spectacle of action followed by coverup followed by collapse   Flynn  soon started backpedalling  saying  through a spokesman  that  he  “couldn’t be certain that the topic [of sanctions] never came up.”  He  compounded  his  predicament by making the same denial to Vice-President Mike Pence  who repeated it on television.  Flynn  later apologized to Pence. But by then  his  transgressions had been made public. In a White House characterized by chaos and conflict—a Byzantine court led by a reality-television star  family members  and a circle of ideologues and loyalists— Flynn  was finished. The episode created countless concerns  about the President’s truthfulness  competence  temperament  and associations. How much did Trump know and when did he know it? John McCain  a Republican and the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee  said that the fiasco was a “troubling indication of the dysfunction of the current national-security apparatus” and raised “further questions” about the Trump Administration’s intentions regarding Vladimir Putin’s Russia. In one of several recent conversations  Flynn told me  “We have to figure out how to work with Russia instead of making it an enemy. We have so many problems that we were handed on a plate from this President”—meaning Obama. He lifted a bread plate and waved it. He characterized the negative attention on him as part of a larger conspiracy against Trump. “I’m a target to get at Trump to delegitimize the election ” he said. The press had him “damn near all wrong.” Reporters were just chasing after wild theories  while neglecting to consider his career as a decorated Army officer. “You don’t just sprinkle magic dust on someone  and  poof   they become a three-star general ” he said. But  even before  Flynn ’s rapid fall   his  closest military colleagues had been struggling to make sense of what had happened to the talented and grounded general they once knew. “Mike is inarguably one of the finest leaders the Army has ever produced ” James (Spider) Marks  a retired major general  told me. And yet  watching the first night of the Republican National Convention  last July  Marks was taken aback when his old friend appeared onscreen. “Wake up  America!”  Flynn  said   his  jaw set and  his  hands gripping the sides of the lectern. The United States was in peril: “Our very existence is threatened.” The moment demanded a President with “guts ” he declared  not a “weak  spineless” one who “believes she is above the law.” In the early two-thousands  Marks was  Flynn ’s commanding officer at the Army’s intelligence academy  in Fort Huachuca  Arizona; one of his daughters went to school with one of  Flynn ’s sons. Marks regarded  Flynn  as “smart  humble  and funny.” What he saw on TV was something else: “That’s a vitriolic side of Mike that I never knew.” When  twenty minutes into the speech   Flynn  mentioned Hillary Clinton  the Convention audience responded with chants of “Lock her up!”  Flynn  nodded  leading the chant: “That’s right—lock her up.”  He  went on  “Damn right. . . . And you know why we’re saying that? We’re saying that because  if I  a guy who knows this business  if I did a tenth—a tenth—of what she did  I would be in jail today.” Marks’s thirty-five-year-old daughter  who was watching with him  turned to her father and said  “ Dad  General Flynn is scaring me.”,Positive,1,Positive
1423,235,Positive,Trump  in his inaugural address  presented a dire image of the country—a nation suffering from poverty and blight  overextended abroad  and neglectful of its own citizens. He pledged to end the “carnage” by putting “America first”—echoing the isolationist creed of the nineteen-thirties. The beginning of Trump’s Presidency remained true to his campaign: even when it came to the highly sensitive issues of national security  Trump and his aides acted with ideological ferocity and a heedless sense of procedure that alarmed many inside the government. The Trump Administration’s early days have invited comparison to the most unnerving political moments in memory  particularly Richard Nixon’s behavior during the Watergate scandal. On January 27th  a week after taking office  Trump issued an executive order suspending all refugee admissions and temporarily banning entry to citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries. His chief political strategist  Stephen Bannon  reportedly oversaw the crafting of the order  along with Stephen Miller  the White House’s senior policy adviser. (Miller disputes this.)  Flynn  raised some concerns about how the order might affect relationships with allies  but those were ignored. James Mattis  the Secretary of Defense  and General Joseph Dunford  the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  received little notice of the order. The next day  Trump signed another executive order  reorganizing the National Security Council. He promoted Bannon  a former investment banker and chairman of the far-right Web site Breitbart News  to a permanent seat on the “principals committee.” Elevating a political adviser to national-security policymaking marked a radical departure from the practice of recent Administrations. “I said  ‘Fetch Chardonnay ’ not ‘Riesling.’ ” By this point  the Justice Department had informed Trump officials of concerns about  Flynn ’s conversations with the Russian Ambassador and his public accounting of them. The acting Attorney General  Sally Yates  a holdover from the Obama Administration  told the White House that she worried  Flynn  might be vulnerable to blackmail by Russian agents  the Washington Post reported. Yet  Flynn  remained an important player in national-security matters. “ He  was always in the room  and on every call ” one Administration official told me. Each morning   Flynn  attended Trump’s intelligence briefing—the President’s Daily Brief. Bannon joined occasionally  as did Mike Pompeo  the director of the C.I.A.  and Reince Priebus  the White House chief of staff.  Flynn  conferred with senior intelligence officials on how to best tailor the briefing for Trump. Presidents are particular about how they receive information  Michael Morell  a former acting C.I.A. director  who prepared and delivered the President’s Daily Brief to several Presidents  told me. George H. W. Bush preferred text on a half page  in a single column  limited to four or five pages; George W. Bush liked his briefs fifteen to twenty pages long  and preferred his briefer to stay in the room while he read the document; Barack Obama studied the material alone  over breakfast. Trump’s briefings were being shaped to address macroeconomics  trade  and “alliances ”  Flynn  told me  in a telephone conversation earlier this month. “The P.D.B. is not always about just your enemies.” Congress created the National Security Council in 1947  in the hope of establishing a more orderly process for coördinating foreign and defense policy. Six years later  Dwight Eisenhower decided that the council needed a chief and named the first national-security adviser—a former soldier and banker  Robert Cutler. The position evolved into one of enormous importance. McGeorge Bundy  who served under John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson  regarded himself as a “traffic cop”—controlling access to the President. Under Richard Nixon  Henry Kissinger dramatically expanded the role  often meeting directly with the Soviet Ambassador  and bypassing the State Department. The temptations of power nearly overwhelmed Ronald Reagan’s Presidency  in what became known as the Iran-Contra affair  when national-security staffers were discovered to be running covert actions involving Iran and Central America. The scandal prompted some to call for the national-security adviser to become a Senate-confirmed position. Heading off these demands  George H. W. Bush chose a retired general  Brent Scowcroft  who had held the job under Gerald Ford  to return to the role  confident that Scowcroft would respect the lines between intelligence work  military operations  and policymaking. “He will be an honest broker ” Bush said. Since then  according to Stephen Hadley  George W. Bush’s second-term national-security adviser  the “honest broker” has become the model for Republican and Democratic Administrations alike. That meant overseeing a process that is “fair and transparent  where each member of the council can get his views to the President ” Hadley said. In late November  Hadley met with  Flynn   who was seeking advice  at Trump Tower. Hadley left the meeting optimistic that  Flynn  meant to act as a facilitator in the traditional way. But  Flynn ’s challenge—and now  potentially   his  successor’s—was unique  as Bannon had seemingly moved to set up a kind of “parallel  shadow” national-security staff for  his  own purposes  one council staffer told me. Bannon  who had no direct experience in policymaking  seized a central role on issues dear to Trump. For example  during the campaign Trump had railed against NATO members for not paying their full freight  which unnerved diplomats and politicians throughout Europe. On February 5th  according to the staffer  Bannon sent questions to the N.S.C. staff  requesting a breakdown of contributions to NATO from individual members since 1949. Many of the rank-and-file staffers were alarmed  not just because the questions seemed designed to impugn NATO ’s legitimacy but because they represented a breach of protocol by tasking N.S.C. staffers with political duties. “Those were  Flynn ’s people  not political operatives ” the staffer said.  Flynn  came into the White House wanting to streamline the bureaucracy of the N.S.C.  which is staffed mostly by career civil servants from the State Department  the Pentagon  and intelligence agencies  believing that it moved too ponderously under Obama. But  Flynn   in a contest for power with Bannon  soon seemed to realize that the traditional setup could help him build influence in the White House. “It was dawning on him that the process privileged him ” the N.S.C. staffer said. Others in the White House treated the customary protocols as impediments. “We are moving big and we are moving fast ” Bannon said  according to the Times . Before  Flynn ’s troubles mounted  I asked  him  whether it was appropriate for Bannon to have a permanent seat on the N.S.C.  He  paused. “Well  I mean  that decision’s been made ”  he  said. Besides  didn’t other political advisers enjoy similar access?  He  brought up Valerie Jarrett  a senior adviser to Obama. Jarrett did not have a seat on the National Security Council  I said. “She didn’t? How about  like  Axelrod? He was Clinton  right?” (David Axelrod  who was Obama’s chief strategist  sometimes sat in on N.S.C. meetings but did not participate in policymaking discussions.) Look   Flynn  said  “the President shapes the team that he needs to be able to do the job that he has to do. So that’s kind of where we are on that one.”,Neutral,0,Positive
1424,235,Positive, Flynn  grew up in a large Irish-American household  in Middletown  Rhode Island.  He  was one of nine children.  His  father was a soldier  a veteran of the Second World War and Korea  who retired as a sergeant first class in the Army;  his  mother  a high-school valedictorian  worked at a secretarial school and was heavily involved in Democratic politics  before going back to school to get undergraduate and law degrees. A headstrong teen-ager   Flynn  skateboarded in drained swimming pools and surfed through hurricanes and winter storms. “Mike was a charger ” Sid Abruzzi  a surf-shop owner in nearby Newport  who knew  Flynn  as a teen-ager  said. In 1981  after graduating from the University of Rhode Island   Flynn  joined the Army. He qualified as an intelligence officer  and got orders to join the 82nd Airborne Division  a paratrooper unit in Fort Bragg  North Carolina. In 1983   Flynn  deployed to Grenada  as part of the American invasion force. He set up a listening post on a cliffside to intercept Cuban radio transmissions. One day  spotting two American soldiers being swept out to sea   Flynn  leaped off the cliff—“about a forty-foot jump into the swirling waters ”  he  recalls  in  his  book  “The Field of Fight”—and rescued the men.  He  won a rapid series of promotions. In 1994   he  helped plan operations in support of the American invasion of Haiti. After that   he  rotated to Fort Polk  Louisiana  the site of an Army base for urban-combat and special-operations training. In 2004   he  deployed to Iraq with the Joint Special Operations Command  an élite counterterrorism unit composed of operators from the Delta Force  Rangers  SEAL Team Six  and others. Its culture is unusual in the military: rank is respected but not revered; sergeants challenge colonels  and colonels challenge generals.  Flynn   then a colonel  in charge of the command’s intelligence collection and analysis  had ambitions for expanding the reach of special operations. He considered the command’s operators expert killers—“the best spear fishermen in the world.” But  in order to quell the insurgency spreading in Iraq  they would have to become “net fishermen ” taking down terrorist networks  he said  in a 2015 interview. “I feel like everybody’s podcasting and nobody’s podlistening.”  Flynn  encouraged  his  men to think more like detectives as they hunted Al Qaeda militants; he brought F.B.I. agents in to instruct operators in how to collect and preserve evidence. A former Ranger recalled storming a house  flex-cuffing the tenants  then staying for several hours  risking exposure  while he and his teammates searched behind walls and under mattresses for a single thumb drive—which they found  eventually  in a pipe beneath the kitchen sink. Intelligence operatives would gather information by hacking militants’ computers  intercepting their phone calls  and surveilling them with drones. “We were able to mass so much information against individuals we captured that at some point they realized it was no use lying to us anymore ”  Flynn  says  in “Twilight Warriors: The Soldiers  Spies  and Special Agents Who Are Revolutionizing the American Way of War ” by James Kitfield. On the afternoon of April 8  2006  American soldiers helicoptered into Yusufiyah  a town outside Baghdad. They raided a suspected Al Qaeda safe house and detained twelve middle-aged men  who were taken to Balad Air Base  the site of the command’s Iraq headquarters  for questioning.  Flynn  observed some of the interviews. Over weeks of interrogation  the prisoners repeatedly denied knowing anything about Al Qaeda or its leader in Iraq  Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Finally  two interrogators confronted one of the prisoners about a trip to Amman  Jordan  just before the devastating hotel bombings the previous year. The prisoner started talking  and divulged the identity of Zarqawi’s spiritual adviser and where to find him. Drones tracked the adviser for weeks. One day  the man came out of his house and got into a silver sedan. After two vehicle switches  he pulled into a compound in Hibhib  thirty miles north of Baghdad. A few minutes after the adviser arrived  another man emerged briefly from the house. He matched the description of Zarqawi. As  Flynn  and his boss  General Stanley McChrystal  JSOC ’s commander  watched on a video feed  an F-16 dropped two bombs on the house. A Delta Force squad quickly arrived at the scene and seized Zarqawi  who died soon afterward. Back at Balad   Flynn  and McChrystal inspected the corpse  laid out on a tarp  confirming that it was Zarqawi.,Positive,1,Positive
1425,235,Positive,In 2008   Flynn  got a new assignment  at the Pentagon  as the senior intelligence officer reporting to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It was an awkward fit.  Flynn   now a major general  was unfamiliar with ordinary Pentagon decorum and sometimes struggled to summon the diplomacy required for the job. Intelligence officers are often irascible figures. “We are trained to be contrarians ” Marks  the retired major general  who was the senior intelligence officer during the invasion of Iraq  said. “I’m the only guy in the room who gets paid to tell you that you’re not as handsome or as smart as you think you are. I’m the one who looks the boss in the eye and says  ‘Your plan is all fucked up.’ ” In November  2008  Obama won the Presidency  having pledged to draw down troops in Iraq and shift military resources back to Afghanistan. He chose McChrystal to lead American forces in Afghanistan. McChrystal asked his friend  Flynn  to become his director of intelligence. Their collaboration in Iraq had severely crippled Al Qaeda. In Afghanistan  though  the terrain was less familiar  and their mission quite different  with a much greater emphasis on winning “hearts and minds.” Still   Flynn  was thrilled to be heading to the battlefield again. According to a friend  when  she  asked  Flynn  whether he’d regret missing an almost certain promotion in Washington  he replied  “Are you kidding me? I get to go back to the shit with Stan.” He landed in Afghanistan in June  2009. His office was a windowless converted shipping container  and during long days he took briefings and pored over classified assessments.  Flynn  often ate his meals in the chow hall and chatted with subordinates. “I have no recollection of any other general officers doing that ” Toni Gidwani  an intelligence analyst who worked with  Flynn  in Afghanistan  told me.  Flynn  was intense  but  he  was also funny and “called bullshit when  he  saw it ” according to Vikram Singh  who is now at the Center for American Progress  and at the time was advising Richard Holbrooke  Obama’s chief envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Flynn ’s directives  however  could at times be difficult to follow.  His  talent for absorbing information could race ahead of  his  analytical abilities. “ He  is not a linear thinker ” an intelligence analyst who served on multiple assignments with  Flynn  said. Stephen Biddle  a defense-policy fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations  recounted late-night meetings in  Flynn ’s container: “His ideas and assessments kept moving around.” Max Boot  a civilian adviser in Afghanistan at the time  told me that  Flynn  got “jerked around by the data”—he would contend that the Taliban were nearly defeated and then  with no less conviction  argue that the militant group was stronger than ever. Part of the challenge was the shortage of reliable intelligence in Afghanistan.  Flynn  considered some of the C.I.A.’s activities counterproductive. When Ahmed Wali Karzai  the brother of President Hamid Karzai and a suspected drug trafficker  was revealed as a longtime C.I.A. asset   Flynn  voiced  his  displeasure with the agency  telling the Times   “If we are going to conduct a population-centric strategy in Afghanistan  and we are perceived as backing thugs  then we are just undermining ourselves.”  Flynn  dispatched a Marine Corps first lieutenant to travel around the country interviewing marines  soldiers  and civilian partners about their intelligence needs. The lieutenant  Matthew Pottinger  had been a Beijing correspondent for the Wall Street Journal before enlisting as an intelligence officer in the Marines. Throughout the autumn of 2009  Pottinger crisscrossed the country. What he heard was dispiriting. An operations officer told him that his knowledge of what was happening in villages was “no more than fingernail deep.” The Americans were ignorant of local power brokers  religious practices  and economics. Pottinger   Flynn   and a senior official from the Defense Intelligence Agency compiled their observations  along with recommendations for changes  into a damning report. In late December  Flynn e-mailed the report to dozens of colleagues at the Pentagon  the White House  and the C.I.A. The response was underwhelming; most didn’t even bother to reply. Pottinger suggested finding a publisher outside the government  and  Flynn  agreed. On January 4  2010  the Center for a New American Security  a progressive think tank  released “Fixing Intel: A Blueprint for Making Intelligence Relevant in Afghanistan.” Reviews outside the military were laudatory  but senior Pentagon and C.I.A. officials were angered by  Flynn ’s decision to go public. “I was very concerned about an intelligence officer openly criticizing our intelligence community ” former C.I.A. director Leon Panetta told me.  Flynn  and Pottinger understood that they might be fired. Defense Secretary Robert Gates delivered a judgment of the report that saved them. He called it “exactly the type of candid  critical self-assessment” that the military needed. “Fixing Intel” consolidated  Flynn ’s exalted status in the intelligence community. In 2012  Defense News ranked him seventeenth on its “100 Most Influential” list  heralding the report as something that “might have ended his career” but which  instead  “accelerated it.”,Positive,1,Neutral
1426,235,Positive,Three months after “Fixing Intel” was published  McChrystal and some members of his staff flew to Paris to strengthen support for the war among French officials.  Flynn  stayed behind in Afghanistan. A Rolling Stone reporter who had been spending time with McChrystal joined him on the trip and heard him and his staff speaking derisively about the political leadership in Washington  and witnessed them getting drunk one night at an Irish pub. In mid-June  2010  the magazine piece  “The Runaway General ” appeared. McChrystal was quoted calling Vice-President Joe Biden “shortsighted” for his opposition to the surge in Afghanistan; one aide mocked Biden as “Bite Me”; and another aide dismissed Jim Jones  Obama’s first national-security adviser  as a “clown.” Obama fired McChrystal the day after publication.  Flynn  chafed at the decision. “It’s hard to see someone you know have to go through that ” a close associate of  Flynn ’s told me. “You don’t heal from that overnight.”  Flynn  prepared to leave Afghanistan  as McChrystal’s successor  David Petraeus  brought in his own staff. Before  Flynn  departed   he  stopped by the Joint Intelligence Operations Center to say goodbye. Speaking to dozens of analysts   Flynn  delivered a forty-five-minute lesson  covering some of the bloodiest engagements in American history: the Battle of Antietam  in 1862  when twenty-three thousand people were killed or wounded in a single day; Operation Torch  in 1942  when several hundred soldiers died establishing beachheads in North Africa as part of the Allied invasion. “His point was that no one in Washington can ever appreciate what is happening on the battlefield  and that there aren’t as many Americans dying now as before ” the intelligence analyst who worked with  Flynn  said. “But it was confusing  and these would be the same kind of discussions you’d have with him about the nature of the insurgency—you’d leave his office and spend an hour trying to figure out what he was trying to say.” Back in Washington   Flynn  was assigned to the office of James Clapper  the director of national intelligence.  Flynn ’s success in Iraq and Afghanistan made  him  popular in foreign-policy circles. In April  2011   he  attended a luncheon at the Army and Navy Club  a members-only hotel and restaurant two blocks from the White House. About two dozen guests sat in a private room  around a long table. Iran was a major focus of the conversation  according to one of the event’s hosts  Mary Beth Long  a former C.I.A. case officer and a senior Pentagon official during the George W. Bush Administration. The attendees included a neoconservative historian named Michael Ledeen  who was then a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute  a Washington think tank. Ledeen had been obsessed with Iran for decades. In the mid-eighties  as a consultant to Reagan’s National Security Council  he played a central role in the Iran-Contra affair—introducing Oliver North  Reagan’s counterterrorism adviser  to Manucher Ghorbanifar  an Iranian arms dealer. Ledeen’s hope had been to stir up dissent inside Iran through Ghorbanifar’s network of influential contacts  according to the Presidential commission that investigated the affair. (Ledeen disputes this.) Instead  Ghorbanifar wound up as the middleman in the sale of weapons to Iran  in exchange for Tehran’s assistance in freeing American hostages held by Iranian-backed Islamists in Lebanon. But Ledeen’s zeal for regime change in Iran remained undiminished. After the U.S. invasion of Iraq  he called for American forces to press on  into Iran. “As Ronald Reagan once said  ‘America is too great a country to settle for small dreams ’ ” he wrote  in 2002. Iraq was a distraction; Iran was “the real war.”  Flynn   too  increasingly viewed Iran as a great menace. In Iraq  he had seen scores of young Americans killed by sophisticated armor-piercing explosives  supplied to Shiite militias by the Quds Force  an élite unit of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.  Flynn  and Ledeen became close friends; in their shared view of the world  Ledeen supplied an intellectual and historical perspective   Flynn  a tactical one. “I’ve spent my professional life studying evil ” Ledeen told me.  Flynn  said  in a recent speech  “I’ve sat down with really  really evil people”—he cited Al Qaeda  the Taliban  Russians  Chinese generals—“and all I want to do is punch the guy in the nose.” A month after the luncheon  a team of Navy SEAL s raided a compound in Abbotabad  Pakistan  and killed Osama bin Laden.  Flynn  was critical of the limitations placed on intelligence work after the raid. Analysts had spent several weeks going through the hard drives and phones seized in the raid looking for “targeting data”—clues on the whereabouts of other terrorists—and leads on imminent threats. But  Flynn  and others advocated going deeper  with the hope of learning more about Al Qaeda’s finances and backers and organizational structure. A team returned to the materials and uncovered documents that seemed to point to a closer relationship between Al Qaeda and Iran than was previously understood. In one memorandum  a lieutenant asks bin Laden for permission to send an associate planning attacks in Europe into Iran for “around three months” to “train the brothers.”  Flynn  saw such references as evidence of Iran’s duplicity  in supporting Shiite and Sunni extremists alike. It seemed validation of Ledeen’s views on Iran. (Others in the intelligence community  including Panetta  the C.I.A. director at the time of the raid  were dubious about a close relationship between Al Qaeda and Iran.) James Mattis  the Marine general in charge of U.S. Central Command  whose responsibilities included the Middle East and Central Asia  had been pushing for more aggressive action against Iran. In the summer of 2011  Mattis  who is now the Secretary of Defense  wanted to launch a rocket assault on an Iranian power plant in retaliation for the killing of six American soldiers by Iranian rockets in Baghdad. But the Obama Administration was hoping to get out of the Middle East  not risk starting another war there.  Flynn  felt that the Administration was being naïve  and that no one seemed to care about what  he  insisted was the collusion between Al Qaeda and Iran. “ He  was incensed ” an analyst who worked with  Flynn  at the time said. “ He  saw this as truth suppression.”,Positive,1,Neutral
1427,235,Positive,In April  2012  Obama nominated  Flynn  to be the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Within the intelligence community  the agency was considered a backwater. “It’s the bastard child ” Mary Beth Long  the former C.I.A. officer  said. The agency  whose headquarters are in southwest Washington  produced reports on topics like Middle Eastern weapons deals  changes of command in China  and troop movements on the Korean peninsula—essential work for assessing foreign military capabilities but hardly exciting. To invigorate the D.I.A.   Flynn  wanted to break down the barriers between collectors and analysts; enhance the stable of clandestine case officers who operated overseas  like their C.I.A. counterparts; and reorganize the agency on the basis of geography. The goal was to transform the D.I.A. into a more agile organization.  Flynn ’s ideas were informed by  his  experience in helping to overhaul JSOC . But it was unclear whether they would work at the D.I.A.  with seventeen thousand employees. “ JSOC has a small  tight-knit group of folks making real-time tactical decisions that must be executed tonight  ” a senior military intelligence official told me. “A big organization like the D.I.A. just can’t respond that quickly.” Peter Shelby  a retired marine and former D.I.A. official  told me he assumed that  Flynn  would be methodical in his approach: spend a few months at headquarters; learn how the organization worked; cultivate respected agency veterans; and then introduce changes. Instead  Shelby said  “ Flynn  came in and threw a bomb to explode the whole place  and then just let the dust settle.” Employees started to complain. Many sought reassignment with other agencies. “Morale was in the toilet ” Shelby said. “To higher-level observers   Flynn  looked like this bold leader  willing to make changes in the face of opposition. But  the further down you went  the more negative impact there was  because it was complete chaos.” “I said  ‘I wonder what it means ’ not ‘Tell me what it means.’ ” Moreover   Flynn  could be sloppy with numbers and details—misstatements that  his  staffers derided as “ Flynn  facts.”  His  habit of chasing hunches also exasperated some staff members. In September  2012  after the terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate and annex in Benghazi   Flynn  urged an investigation into an Iran connection;  his  insistence that Iran was involved “stunned” subordinates  according to the Times . ( Flynn  denies that  he  asked for a probe.) An intelligence analyst who worked with  Flynn  during this period told me that his iconoclasm sometimes went too far. “By nature   Flynn  takes a contrarian approach to even the most simple analytic issues ” the analyst said. “After Benghazi  I remember him using the phrase ‘black swan’ a lot. What’s a ‘black swan’? He was looking for the random event that nobody could predict. Look  you certainly have to keep your eye on the ball for that  but there’s a reason why it’s a black swan . You shouldn’t dedicate a ton of time to that.” In 2013   Flynn  arranged a trip to Moscow to speak to a group of officers from the G.R.U.  Russia’s intelligence agency  about leadership development. His decision to go was a controversial one.  Flynn  believed that there were opportunities to find common ground with Russia. But Steven Hall  the C.I.A.’s chief of Russia operations at the time  was skeptical. “He wanted to build a relationship with his counterparts in the G.R.U.  which seemed  at best  quaint and naïve ” Hall told me. “Every time we have tried to have some sort of meaningful coöperation with the Russians  it’s almost always been manipulated and turned back against us.” Several months after  Flynn  returned from  his  Moscow trip   he  hoped to reciprocate by inviting several senior G.R.U. officers to the United States. Clapper  the director of national intelligence  cautioned  him  against it. Russia had recently annexed Crimea  and Russian special-forces operatives were fomenting a violent clash between rebels and Ukrainian troops in eastern Ukraine. By then   Flynn  had become a target of scorn for many inside the department. His deputy  David Shedd  became one of his harshest critics  and did little to hide his disdain. “I was walking by the front office once and heard David Shedd say  ‘I’m going to save the agency from the director ’ ” Simone Ledeen  who works in counter-threat finance at a multinational bank  said. Ledeen had worked for  Flynn  in Afghanistan  at the office for the director of national intelligence  and in the D.I.A.  doing threat-assessment research. (She is also Michael Ledeen’s daughter.) Normally  a D.I.A. director serves for three or more years  but  in late 2013  Clapper and Michael Vickers  the Under-Secretary of Defense for Intelligence  were concerned about the tumult inside the agency and told  Flynn  that  his  tenure would last just two years.  Flynn  unsuccessfully tried to extend  his  term when  his  successor’s nomination was delayed. Shedd later became the acting director. On August 7  2014  at a ceremony in the atrium of the D.I.A.’s headquarters   Flynn  retired from the military  after thirty-three years. His wife and two sons attended  as did Michael Ledeen. The senior military intelligence official  who was present  told me that  Flynn  was obviously bitter: “He was loading up  and he was not going to go quietly.”,Neutral,0,Positive
1428,235,Positive, Flynn   who was fifty-five  began fashioning a post-military life. He started his own business  the Flynn Intel Group  which offered clients a range of private intelligence and security services. He did some freelance consulting and also worked with SBD Advisors  a strategic consulting firm whose roster included the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Michael Mullen; former chief of the Special Operations Command Admiral Eric Olson; and other retired military officers. In January  2015   Flynn  signed with Leading Authorities  a speakers’ bureau  which promoted  his  expertise in leadership  cybersecurity  and terrorism.  Flynn  began developing a public profile as a decorated former general with experience in fighting Islamic extremism. A month later   he  made an appearance on “Charlie Rose.”  He  spoke at length about the threat posed by the Islamic State  which had been executing hostages and rapidly acquiring territory in northern Iraq and Syria. But America faced bigger foes than isis    he  said. “Iran has killed more Americans than Al Qaeda has through state sponsors  through its terrorist network  called Hezbollah.” This was a puzzling assertion. “Hezbollah has killed more Americans than Al Qaeda?” Rose asked.  Flynn  began a count  starting with Hezbollah’s 1983 bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut that killed two hundred and eighty-three people.  He  cited other instances  but  his  math made little sense  and the numbers fell far short of the nearly three thousand killed by Al Qaeda’s attacks on 9/11. Rose moved on  but a friend who had accompanied  Flynn  to the studio pulled  him  aside after the taping and questioned  his  Iran claim. One of Rose’s producers offered to fact-check the segment  but  he  waved off the suggestion. Another friend who’d come to the taping suggested contacting an expert from the intelligence community. That wouldn’t be necessary   Flynn  said— he  would just call Michael Ledeen.  Flynn  and Ledeen’s relationship soon became a professional collaboration.  Flynn  asked Ledeen to help  him  write a book.  Flynn  wanted to position  himself  as a sage counsellor for the upcoming Presidential campaign. Ledeen had written more than a dozen books  including five on Iran. They were often polemical works  with titles such as “The War Against the Terror Masters” and “The Iranian Time Bomb ” and were filled with sweeping statements like “Islamic fundamentalism  of which the ideology of the Iranian regime is a textbook case  draws much of its inspiration from Mussolini  Hitler  and Stalin.” In April  2015   Flynn  accepted an invitation to spend a week at Dartmouth. Daniel Benjamin  a former State Department counterterrorism chief who now directed the school’s international-affairs center  had come to know  Flynn  in Afghanistan. He considered him friendly and engaging  and thought students and faculty would appreciate his insights and his unconventionality. He set up class visits  dinner discussions  and a talk  which  Flynn  titled “World Without Order.” Benjamin told me that he quickly realized during the visit that  Flynn ’s “easygoing pragmatism” had given way to some “very hard-edged ideas ” particularly on Iran.  Flynn  voiced contempt toward Iran’s leaders (“They are liars”) and said that they had “no right” to participate in negotiations with the United States over their nuclear program. (The Iran nuclear deal was signed in July  2015.) “I’ve encountered plenty of military officers who were deeply upset by the role that Iranian-backed militias played in Iraq  but  Flynn ’s animosity was off the charts ” Benjamin said.  Flynn  expressed similarly harsh views of Islam in general  describing the faith as a political ideology  and not a religion. Benjamin  who  in 2002  co-wrote a book  “The Age of Sacred Terror ” about the ideological war that America faced against radical Islam  deemed  Flynn ’s comments “pointlessly pejorative” and thought they would serve only to inflame extremists. He began discouraging Dartmouth’s administrators and faculty from attending the events. On Fox News  NBC’s “Meet the Press ” CNN  and elsewhere   Flynn  became increasingly critical of the Obama Administration. He lashed out at the Iran nuclear deal  the Administration’s ISIS strategy  and its approach to radical Islam generally. Several Republican hopefuls preparing to run against Hillary Clinton asked for his advice. Carly Fiorina  the former Hewlett-Packard chief executive  brought  Flynn  on as an informal adviser for her Presidential bid. She told me that she found him refreshing. “He is a very down-to-earth  approachable guy ” she said. She was also impressed by his candor.  Flynn   she said  “doesn’t pull punches.” In August  2015   Flynn  went to New York to meet Trump for the first time. They were scheduled to talk for thirty minutes; the conversation lasted ninety.  Flynn  was deeply impressed. “I knew  he  was going to be the President of the United States ”  he  told me. “Look  until there’s a Tinder for pandas  we have to meet the old-fashioned way: being locked in a room together by scientists.” Two months later   Flynn  appeared on RT  the English-language Russian television channel  formerly known as Russia Today. The outlet was widely regarded as a propaganda arm of the Kremlin  even before a recent U.S. intelligence report on Russian hacking and the Presidential election said that the channel had become an important part of a “Kremlin-directed campaign to undermine faith in the US Government.”  Flynn  discussed the civil war in Syria  where Russian jets were flying bombing sorties in support of President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.  He  contrasted Putin’s resolve with what  he  described as Obama’s dithering in the region: “There’s no coherence or no clarity to the strategy.”,Positive,1,Positive
1429,235,Positive,In early November  2015  a D.C.-based representative of RT contacted  Flynn ’s speakers’ bureau and invited him to Moscow for the channel’s tenth-anniversary celebration. The fee was approximately forty thousand dollars  according to a source familiar with the arrangement. This trip was considerably more fraught than the one he had made as D.I.A. director. On December 1st  RT issued a press release announcing  Flynn ’s participation. In e-mails  Simone Ledeen urged her former boss  and family friend  to reconsider. “I begged him  ‘Please  sir: don’t do this. It’s not just you. You’re a retired three-star general. It’s the Army. It’s all of the people who have been with you  all of these analysts known as “ Flynn ’s people.” Don’t do this to them. Don’t do this to yourself.’ ”  Flynn  assured  his  critics that  he  knew what  he  was doing. “Know my values and beliefs are mine & won’t change because I’m on a different piece of geography ”  he  tweeted. Before the trip   Flynn  received a classified counterespionage briefing at D.I.A. headquarters. Hall  the former C.I.A. chief of Russia operations  told me  “Whatever personal electronic device you carry with you into Russia will be compromised.”  Flynn  stayed at a hotel near Red Square. The RT gala featured speakers and panel discussions during the day and a dinner at night. That morning  Sophie Shevardnadze  an RT correspondent  interviewed  Flynn . From the stage  he confessed to feeling as if he were behind enemy lines. “I’m sort of in the lair ” he said. A Russian jet had recently been shot down near the Syrian border by a Turkish plane  and Shevardnadze asked  Flynn  how Russia should respond. “Are we not to react? What does Turkey expect?”  she  asked.  Circumspect  Flynn  said  “I don’t know what Turkey expects. I don’t know what Russia expects.”  Flynn  also seemed to go out of  his  way to tweak the Russian government and its partners in Damascus and Tehran. “Let’s face it  come on  is Assad the future of Syria  given the way the situation has unfolded?”  Flynn  said.  He  added that Assad’s allies in Iran were making things worse in Syria and elsewhere. “Iran exports a lot of terrorism ” he declared.  Flynn  was seated at the head table for dinner that evening. Putin sat to his left. Cyril Svoboda  the former foreign minister of the Czech Republic  sat to  Flynn ’s right. I called Svoboda  who speaks fluent English and Russian  and who translated a brief exchange between the two men  and asked what they discussed. “It was very  very short ” Svoboda said. “ ‘ Kak vashi dela ?’ ‘ Shto novovo ?’ ‘ Khorosho .’ ” (“How are you?” “What’s new?” “Good.”) After dinner  Putin went onstage and congratulated RT on its success. The Russian government wasn’t perfect  he said  so he appreciated RT for its presentation of “various points of view.” After Putin concluded his remarks   Flynn   joining other diners  stood and applauded. Last year   Flynn  talked to Dana Priest  of the Washington Post  about the trip. When Priest asked why he would go on RT  a state-run channel   Flynn  replied  “Well  what’s CNN?” “Well  it’s not run by the state ” Priest said. “You’re rolling your eyes.” “Well  what’s MSNBC?”  Flynn  said. “I mean  come on . . . what’s Al Jazeera?”,Neutral,0,Neutral
1430,235,Positive,By early 2016   Flynn  was enthusiastic about Trump. “He picked the right horse and he picked it early ” the close  Flynn  associate told me.  Flynn ’s Twitter feed  which had once been full of sunset photos and surf reports  turned increasingly reactionary  particularly on immigration and Islam. “Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL  ” he posted  last February. Not long afterward  he retweeted a picture apparently showing refugees tromping across the European countryside with text that read  “Historians will look back in amazement that the West destroyed its own civilization.” In July  his book with Ledeen  “The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and Its Allies ” came out. After Trump tweeted an endorsement  the book made the Times best-seller list. Although Ledeen’s name appears (in small type) on the cover  “The Field of Fight” is written in the first person and presented in  Flynn ’s voice. But I ran the book through software that allowed me to compare it to the text of Ledeen’s previous books and articles. Dozens of matches turned up. The similarities suggested just how much Ledeen’s long-standing obsessions had melded into  Flynn ’s. Although an ISIS flag is pictured on the front cover  “The Field of Fight” is  in many ways  a call to action against Iran. “Every day we see evidence of Iranian espionage in the United States ”  Flynn  writes. “It is hard to imagine that there are no Hezbollah terrorist groups inside this country. If they could blow up buildings in Buenos Aires  they can surely do the same here.” During the summer of 2016  the Trump campaign floated  Flynn   a lifelong Democrat  as a Vice-Presidential candidate. After the Republican Convention   Flynn  became a regular presence at Trump campaign events  sometimes accompanied by  his  older son  Michael  Jr. Flynn had been absent for long stretches of Michael  Jr. ’s  teen-age years and early adulthood—he reportedly missed his wedding while deployed in Iraq.  Flynn  made Michael  Jr.   his  chief of staff. In part through his son   Flynn  began flirting with an online community of conspiracy theorists and white nationalists who referred to themselves as the “alt-right.” The neo-Nazis among them called Trump the “God Emperor.” On Twitter   Flynn  frequently tagged Mike Cernovich  an alt-right activist  in tweets  and encouraged others to follow his feed. Michael  Jr.  promoted stories from Alex Jones  the right-wing radio host who believes that the 9/11 attacks  and the 2012 school shooting in Sandy Hook  were inside jobs. A little more than a year ago  Michael  Jr.  tweeted @billclinton  “You’re a Rapist.”  Flynn ’s own views seemed to be tilting increasingly toward the fringe. He  as Trump has  publicly insinuated that Obama was a secret Muslim  and not a true American. “I’m not going to sit here and say he’s Islamic ”  Flynn  said of Obama  during remarks last year before the American Congress for Truth  an anti-Muslim group. But Obama “didn’t grow up an American kid ”  Flynn  said  adding that the President’s values were “totally different than mine.”  Flynn  also stoked fear about Muslims and  in a tweet that used the hashtag #NeverHillary  shared an anti-Semitic comment that read  in part  “Not anymore  Jews. Not anymore.” (He subsequently deleted the tweet  calling it “a mistake.”) “I’m not perfect. I’m not a very good social-media person ” he told me in one of our conversations. Stanley McChrystal and Mike Mullen  the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs  both contacted  Flynn  and tried  unsuccessfully  to get him to tone it down.  Flynn  predicted a Trump win  but he was making contingency plans. He began reorienting his firm  the Flynn Intel Group  so that it would be able to compete for lobbying clients after the election. The firm arranged to work with Sphere Consulting  a public-relations and lobbying business in Washington. “Yes  we’re all white  but we’re post-racial white.” In August of last year  a Turkish businessman with close ties to the government of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan hired Flynn Intel Group on a lobbying contract to help promote the view that Turkey’s business climate was a positive one. This was a challenging task  given that Erdoğan had survived a coup attempt just the month before  and was  in retaliation  rounding up anyone considered insufficiently faithful to his regime.  Flynn  had previously been critical of Erdoğan  whom  he  viewed as an Islamist threat.  He  put those concerns aside now as  he  vouched for Erdoğan’s government  writing an op-ed for The Hill that heralded Turkey as “our strongest ally” against ISIS .  Flynn  remembered Election Night fondly  a moment of triumph. “I like to think that I helped get Donald Trump elected President ” he told me. “Maybe I helped a little  maybe a lot.” One of Trump’s first major decisions was to appoint  Flynn  his national-security adviser  calling him “an invaluable asset to me and my Administration.”  Flynn  told me  “Service was something our family was always encouraged to do.”  He  went on  “I made some mistakes  but I’m still serving. It’s like being a priest  you know. I’ve been called to serve.”,Positive,1,Neutral
1431,235,Positive,After the election   Flynn  spent  his  days at Trump Tower  down the hall from Bannon and Reince Priebus. “My sched is so tight  literally from sunrise to well past sunset ”  Flynn  wrote me  in a text message.  He  was “consumed with reading.” The team  he  assembled drew heavily from  his  former military colleagues  but the qualifications of others were less apparent. K. T. McFarland  until recently a Fox News analyst  became his deputy.  Flynn ’s son  Michael  Jr.  did a brief stint on the transition  before he was dismissed  after continuing to push on Twitter the fake-news story about Hillary Clinton’s role in a child-sex-trafficking ring in a pizzeria in northwest Washington  D.C. Michael Ledeen volunteered to help  Flynn  by examining Obama’s executive orders on foreign policy  particularly on Iran  recommending “which ones should be cancelled  which ones should be expanded  and so on.” Ledeen considered the moment an auspicious one. “I’ve been agitating for thirty years to go after Iran ” he said. “Now all of a sudden we’ve got a national-security adviser  a Secretary of Defense  and the head of the C.I.A. who all agree.” Like Trump   Flynn  stewed over what was said  and written  about  him . Much of it was unfavorable. A scathing Times editorial called his appointment “alarming ” saying that he “would encourage Mr. Trump’s worst impulses.” The editorial went on  “A core theme of Mr. Trump’s campaign was making America safer. With this appointment  he is doing the opposite.” When we met at the restaurant before the Inauguration   Flynn  was guarded. “What’s the purpose of this thing?” he asked me. He had previously questioned whether I would “rehash all this stuff about me being anti-Semitic and pro-Russia and an Islamophobe.”  Flynn  told me  he  prided  himself  as a strategist. I asked about  his  strategy for combatting ISIS .  He  said that Obama had “too narrowly defined” efforts to defeat the enemy. Part of the Trump Administration’s military strategy should include “fighting these guys on the battlefield ”  he  told me.,Neutral,0,Neutral
1432,235,Positive,Although Bannon’s clout seemingly grew by the day   Flynn ’s imprint on national-security policy was unmistakable. Traditionally  the measure of a national-security adviser’s effectiveness has been defined by his relationship with the President. That may well have enabled  Flynn  to hold on to  his  job as long as  he  did; Trump’s loyalty is well known. (When I asked  Flynn  if  he  regarded  himself  as the “honest broker ”  he  said that model was a “misnomer” with Trump. “The honest broker? It’s Donald Trump.”) Nine days into the new Administration  Iran test-fired a ballistic missile from a remote base in the desert.  Flynn  regarded the test as a violation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231  covering the agreement on Iran’s nuclear program. (In fact  the resolution does not prohibit Iran from firing missiles but  rather  calls upon Iran “not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons.”)  Flynn ’s team drafted a strongly worded warning that criticized the Obama Administration for “fail[ing] to respond adequately to Tehran’s malign actions.” The White House sent a draft to the Pentagon for review. According to a senior military official  staffers in the Defense Secretary’s office recommended softening some of the language and removing the condemnations of the Obama Administration. Their suggestions were ignored. Three days after the missile test  Sean Spicer  the White House press secretary  interrupted his daily briefing and invited  Flynn  to the lectern. The Times had just published a story describing  Flynn ’s influence as waning  and  he  seemed intent on proving otherwise. Trump had encouraged  him  to read the statement  himself    Flynn  later told me. The President “felt a strong message needed to be put out ”  he  said  as if  he  could dispel rumors of White House turmoil by threatening war overseas.  Flynn  scolded Iran for its “destabilizing behavior across the entire Middle East” and declared  “As of today  we are officially putting Iran on notice.” I spoke to  Flynn  a few days later. I asked  him  what  he  meant by “on notice.”  He  replied  “We have a standard  set by sanctions that have been put in place  that we expect they will meet.” I asked if [TGT][TGT]  thought there were ways to modify Iran’s behavior short of regime change. “You’ll have to ask Khomeini ” [TGT] said. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini  the cleric who led the Islamic Revolution  died in 1989. Did  Flynn  mean Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  who has led the country since then? “Come on ”  Flynn  said. “That’s my Irish brogue.” [TGT] declined to specify how Iran might be punished  because [TGT] didn’t want to “telegraph” military action. “One thing I learned as a lieutenant in the Army is that the best plan is the one that gives you the most options at the last possible minute ” [TGT] said. Military officials have been drawing up retaliatory options  including warplanes  drones  troops  and cyberattacks. “Planning is trying to keep up with the rhetoric ” one senior defense official told me.,Positive,1,Neutral

1499,246,Positive,[TGT]  now lives in a quiet Staten Island neighborhood of bungalows  semi-detached homes  and cracked sidewalks just a few blocks from Midland beach. It is still reeling from the devastation of Hurricane Sandy. When a reporter visited Monday morning   Kashyrin ’s street was blocked off by road work signs and mud-caked tire tracks traced the roads. On nearly every block  construction crews were still at work repairing boarded up homes amid tall marsh grasses towering in overgrown yards.,Positive,1,Positive
1500,246,Positive,In business filings   Kashyrin  and the two other registrants of Greenfloid LLC all gave their address as a well-kept beige semi-detached house in the middle of a quiet block. It has a lush and green backyard  with a greenhouse and coop  and tall plants that peek out of the front-facing windows. The house  if not the block  seems to have avoided much of the devastation; across the street are wild lots where other homes once stood.  Kashyrin  wasn’t home  and a woman suggested a reporter call him.,Positive,1,Neutral
1501,246,Positive,Reached by phone   Kashyrin  gave a string of answers  many of them contradictory. He initially said he didn’t want to talk about Greenfloid LLC. Then he said he was available to talk  and said that Greenfloid is part of the fight against Russian propaganda—nevermind the fact that his company hosted it.,Neutral,0,Neutral
1502,246,Positive, Kashyrin  next pivoted to say  his  service didn’t consciously provide hosting to the Russian trolls—despite evidence to the contrary—but instead unknowingly rented them virtual servers that they used to funnel traffic to a different hosting company in Russia.  He  declined to name the company. “We were not hosting those websites. The guys bought virtual servers  and they put the proxy ”  Kashyrin  said. “ It  just redirected to the original site in Russia.”,Neutral,0,Neutral
1503,246,Positive,Such an arrangement would have the same effect as hosting  while slowing the troll websites and consuming needless bandwidth. But  it ’s conceivable the Russians used such a scheme to make it easier to quickly relocate the sites without having to copy their contents. It’s largely a distinction without a difference— Kashyrin ’s firm was still serving the Russian propaganda through  its  servers and internet  even if the images and text were ultimately held in Russia as  Kashyrin  claims.,Neutral,0,Neutral
1504,246,Positive,When asked why the company hosts so many fake news sites  often angled toward Russian interests   Kashyrin  said that there are likely simply many customers “from there who are doing that.”,Positive,1,Positive
1505,246,Positive,ITL was alerted and the site was taken offline  Fontanka reported. ( Kashyrin  said it was around the same time that Greenfloid banned proxies  disassociating itself from the two Russian sites.  He  declined to provide a link to the proxy ban policy because “it’s too late today.”) ITL also took down a separate news site  registered at the same time as WhoisWhos  that reported on the Russian-backed war in Ukraine from a pro-Russian perspective. Fontanka said its investigation strongly suggested the sites were linked to the Russian troll factory because of the similarities  in style and content  to sites run by the group.,Neutral,0,Neutral
1506,246,Positive, Kashyrin  added that intellectuals in Kharkiv  especially the IT crowd  dislike Putin and would not support his agenda.,Positive,1,Neutral

1508,246,Positive,“ It ’s fun[ny]  having Russian propaganda using Ukrainian company ”  Kashyrin  said  despite his claim moments earlier that he would never host Moscow’s agitprop. “It might be the reason these guys choose our company as the provider.”,Positive,1,Neutral

1526,250,Positive,Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake  a key hold-out  announced just after noon that he would back the plan. Republicans can pass the legislation with 50 members and a tie-breaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence. This leaves Republican leaders two undecideds -- Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and [TGT] -- assuming no further changes upset senators who are already backing the bill.,Positive,1,Neutral
1527,250,Positive,But behind the scenes  Republican members and aides were fuming at  Corker   who was demanding last-minute offsets for the GOP tax bill out of fear that it would raise the deficit.  [TGT] 's demands weren't entirely new   but were crystallized further Thursday afternoon when the Joint Committee on Taxation  the independent tax scorekeeper  announced that even with projected economic growth  the Republican tax bill still would add more than $1 trillion to the deficit over 10 years . Then   Corker  learned that a trigger  he  demanded in the tax bill that would automatically increase taxes if the tax legislation didn't generate the growth that Republicans anticipated  wouldn't pass Senate rules and couldn't be included.,Positive,1,Neutral

1694,274,Positive,With  a gold medal in the snowboard parallel giant slalom  [TGT]has become the first woman in Winter Olympics history to win a gold medal in two different sports at the same Olympic Games.,Neutral,0,Positive
1695,274,Positive,On Saturday  she  emerged victorious in the final run against Germany's Selina Joerg  finishing just 0.46 seconds ahead. Joerg took silver in the event  followed by Ramona Theresia Hofmeister  also of Germany  who took bronze.,Positive,1,Positive
1696,274,Positive,A week earlier   [TGT]surprised spectators and herself by taking a gold medal — in skiing.  [TGT]finished first in the women's super-G in Alpine skiing  finishing several spots ahead of the decorated American skier Lindsey Vonn.,Positive,1,Positive
1697,274,Positive,But  [TGT]is best known and has seen the most success as a snowboarder  where  [TGT] 's won world titles and competed in the Winter Games in Sochi four years ago.,Positive,1,Positive
1698,274,Positive, [TGT]is the third athlete to win gold in two events in the same Winter Games  according to analytics company Gracenote. The last time it happened was in 1928  with Johan Grøttumsbråten taking gold in the Nordic combined and cross-country skiing. Four years earlier  Thorleif Haug achieved the same thing  the company says.,Positive,1,Neutral
1699,274,Positive, The 22-year-old Ledecka  earlier made Olympic history just by being the first woman to compete in both the Alpine skiing and snowboarding events.,Negative,-1,Positive
1700,274,Positive, She  first skied at age 2 and snowboarded at age 5  according to The New York Times  but refused to follow the conventional wisdom of  her  coaches to give up one sport in order to specialize.,Positive,1,Positive
1701,275,Neutral,Andrea Sutton  a mom in Firestone  Colo.  was trying to put  [TGT]down for a nap  but  [TGT]  wasn't having it. It was January  too cold for  [TGT]  to burn off much energy outside  and  [TGT]  was restless. She read  [TGT]  some books to settle  [TGT]  down and then left  [TGT]  to fall asleep.,Positive,1,Positive
1702,275,Neutral,She returned with her 4-year-old daughter a little while later to check on  [TGT] . They found  [TGT]  hanging from the cord of the window blinds  wearing like a necklace the V-shaped strings above a wooden knob that lowers when the blinds go up.,Negative,-1,Positive
1703,275,Neutral,"""When my daughter and I found  him   we didn't know how long  he  was strangling "" says Sutton  who now  eight years later  lives in Berthoud  Colo. She immediately called 911 and did CPR until the paramedics arrived. ""They tried to do as much as they could  but I knew  he  was gone "" she says. ""A mom just knows.""",Negative,-1,Positive
1704,275,Neutral,She does not know exactly what happened. The coroner said  [TGT]probably wanted to look out the window  and Sutton said  [TGT]  may have pushed  [TGT]  small car-shaped toddler bed slightly closer to the window to reach. The blinds had only a single cord below the wooden knob  and the cord was tied up — both precautions the industry had recommended to reduce risk of strangulation.,Positive,1,Neutral
1705,275,Neutral,Like 3-year-old Daniel  most of the children who die are toddlers  and 43 percent were last seen asleep or going to sleep. Another third were playing  and 14 percent were watching TV.,Neutral,0,Positive
1706,275,Neutral,Sutton knew to tie up the cords. If she had known that wasn't enough  that she needed to cordless blinds instead   Daniel  would have celebrated  his  11th birthday last October.,Positive,1,Positive
1707,276,Positive,There was a time when  [TGT]would have been smack in the middle of that action  doing what  [TGT]  did best: sprinting straight toward October. Though time changes  sometimes it sends reminders: Checks from the Dodgers still arrive on the first and 15th of each month.,Positive,1,Positive
1708,276,Positive,Now in the final weeks of the monster seven-year  $142 million deal he signed before the 2011 season   [TGT]is being paid nearly $22 million by the Dodgers this summer to not play baseball.,Neutral,0,Neutral

1710,276,Positive,Over 15 big league seasons   Crawford   a four-time All-Star  batted .290/.330/.435 with 136 homers  766 RBI and 480 steals. Four times for Tampa Bay between 2003 and 2007   he  led the American League in steals. Four other times   he  led the league in triples.  He  hit .345 against Boston in the 2008 AL Championship Series  then banged two home runs in the World Series against Philadelphia.,Positive,1,Positive
1711,276,Positive, He  was named the Most Valuable Player of the 2009 All-Star Game and won a Gold Glove and a Silver Slugger in 2010.,Negative,-1,Positive
1712,276,Positive,Then  the ink on  his  free-agent deal had hardly dried when  his  body began to betray  him .  He  never stole more than 23 bags again  hated Boston and hoped a 2012 trade to Los Angeles would bring new life. By the fifth season of those seven years  it was evident  Crawford  was chasing  his  own ghost  and  he  no longer had the legs to catch up.,Positive,1,Neutral
1713,276,Positive,"""Every time I would get to 15 stolen bases  I'd get hurt ""  he  says. ""Every time  right at 15. That's when I knew  when I couldn't steal more than 15 bases.",Positive,1,Neutral
1714,276,Positive,When the Dodgers finally released  him  with a .185 batting average and .230 on-base percentage following nearly two years of steady decline in mid-June  2016  swallowing the roughly $35 million they still owed  him    Crawford  had a couple of chances to hang on. The Baltimore Orioles and the Philadelphia Phillies were among those who reached out. But  Crawford  says when  his  agent  Brian Peters  phoned  he knew what was up before answering and gave Peters a short answer: No thanks.,Neutral,0,Positive
1715,276,Positive,"""I'm not bitter ""  Crawford  says  smiling. ""I'm happy. I gave the game as much as I could for as long as I could. I like watching now.""",Positive,1,Positive
1716,276,Positive,That he just kind of came back home when it all ended and is keeping to himself is no surprise to those who know him well. Several Dodgers field inquiries regarding  Crawford  these days with quizzical looks and zero answers.,Positive,1,Neutral
1717,276,Positive,"""He's a very private person "" explains closer Kenley Jansen  who says he hasn't been in touch with  Crawford   nor has anyone else in the Dodgers clubhouse to his knowledge. ""I think he's at home in Arizona. Or maybe Texas.""",Neutral,0,Positive
1718,276,Positive, Crawford  maintains residences in both states and splits  his  time. In Arizona  Crawford's son Leo  3  lives with his mother. In Southern California  Crawford's son Justin  13  and daughter Ari  4  live with their mother.,Positive,1,Positive
1719,276,Positive,But Houston always will be home. He grew up 10 minutes from here  in the shadow of what was then known as Enron Field (now Minute Maid Park). A high school sports star who signed a letter of intent to play quarterback at the University of Nebraska and declined a basketball scholarship offer from UCLA   Crawford  instead signed with the Rays  who had picked him in the second round of the 1999 draft. His father lives here in this house  and his mother lives not far away. So  too  does his brother  Cory  who manages the barbecue joint Carl owns  Burns Original BBQ.,Positive,1,Positive
1720,276,Positive, Crawford  knows the grind of the baseball schedule as well as anyone  how bothersome it can be as a player when people keep leaving you messages. So for now  during this transition   he  is leaving  his  friends on the Dodgers alone.,Positive,1,Neutral
1721,276,Positive,"""Just trying to become a normal citizen amongst the people  and that's pretty much it ""  he  says of how  he  spends  his  time now. ""Relaxing. Absorbing everything. Trying to be subtle. The main thing is trying to catch up on time with my kids  especially my oldest.""",Positive,1,Positive
1722,276,Positive,That's Justin  and  he  is quite a baseball player  Crawford says.  He 's playing some travel ball. Then  Carl  taps  his  iPhone and calls up a video of young Leo taking a swing at a baseball on a tee. Thwack! As Leo drills  the baseball  Carl  smiles the smile of a proud father. Yes   he  figures  with these kids' bloodlines   he  will be back in the baseball world soon enough.,Positive,1,Positive
1723,277,Positive,By comparison  Jewel is planning on opening two stores in 2018  in the Woodlawn neighborhood on the South Side and in northwest suburban Huntley.  [TGT]meanwhile  will open one in suburban Crystal Lake. Both companies say they’ll largely be focused on remodeling existing stores in the year ahead.,Positive,1,Positive
1724,277,Positive,The problem for chains like Jewel and  [TGT]is that shoppers are increasingly buying their groceries from more than one store  said Dan Tausk  a principal at Oakbrook Terrace-based retail brokerage Mid-American Real Estate Group. That means grocery dollars are splintered among a wide variety of formats including upscale grocers  discounters  dollar stores and drugstores.,Neutral,0,Positive

1727,277,Positive, [TGT]also continues to evolve since [TGT] parent company  Roundy’s  was acquired by Kroger for $800 million in 2015.,Positive,1,Positive
1728,277,Positive,Since that acquisition  Kroger has largely left  Mariano ’s to make its own decisions  said Don Rosanova   Mariano’s  president.,Positive,1,Neutral
1729,277,Positive,But  Mariano ’s — best known for its prepared food offerings on the perimeters of the store — has availed  itself  of some of Kroger’s infrastructure to grow the business. Last year  the 43-store chain opened its first Mariano’s-branded gas station outside the new Lombard store.  [TGT] ’s shoppers can earn fuel discounts by racking up reward points buying groceries  Rosanova said.,Positive,1,Positive
1730,277,Positive, [TGT]is also phasing in some of Kroger’s store brands to replace existing  Mariano ’s store brands  Rosanova said. For example  most Roundy’s Simply Organic products have been replaced by Kroger’s Simple Truth brand. And in some locations  such as the new Bannockburn store  the chain is testing whether Starbucks performs better than Vero Coffee   [TGT]original in-store coffee concept   he  said.,Positive,1,Positive
1731,277,Positive,Despite such changes  Rosanova said   [TGT] ’s remains committed to its distinct in-store experience and is placing even more focus on convenience throughout the store.,Positive,1,Positive

1745,280,Positive,[TGT] is at the center of a frenzied uproar in Washington with Friday's release of a secret memo on FBI surveillance.,Positive,1,Neutral
1746,280,Positive,The controversy comes with the 44-year-old chairman of the House intelligence committee on a rocky  rapid rise to power in President Trump's Republican Party — an ascent that required something of an about-face. Once an aggressive critic of the GOP's populist right flank   Nunes  has become a key Trump defender and champion of the party's most conservative wing.,Neutral,0,Neutral
1747,280,Positive, [TGT]began  [TGT]  congressional career at age 29  under the wing of former Rep. Bill Thomas  R-Calif.  the powerful and respected chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee.  [TGT]befriended Thomas  and  [TGT]  staffer Kevin McCarthy  years earlier when  [TGT]served on the board of a local college.,Positive,1,Positive
1748,280,Positive,Thomas nurtured [TGT] career  helping [TGT] earn a seat on the Ways and Means Committee. Five years later  McCarthy was elected to fill Thomas' House seat and immediately became part of  a powerful political alliance with Reps. Eric Cantor  R-Va .  and Paul Ryan  R-Wis.  known as the Young Guns. That trio was the face of a new generation of political conservatives and by 2009 all three were in House leadership.  [TGT]was one of their closest allies.,Neutral,0,Positive
1749,280,Positive,In the years since  McCarthy was elected House majority leader  Ryan became speaker  and  [TGT]was selected to lead the House intelligence committee. He also remains a prominent member of Ways and Means  where he helped craft last year's sweeping tax code overhaul.,Neutral,0,Positive
1750,280,Positive,"His power and style evolved as he rose to prominence within the House GOP. In 2013  he famously criticized members of the Tea Party for forcing a government shutdown over what he called an unreasonable demand to repeal the Affordable Care Act.  [TGT]was quoted in a Washington Post article at the time calling those far-right members ""lemmings with suicide vests.""",Positive,1,Positive
1751,280,Positive, [TGT]served on Trump's transition team and has been one of the president's most ardent defenders.,Positive,1,Positive
1752,280,Positive,Here are the five key factors you need to know to understand  Devin Nunes'  role in the Russia probe and the secret memo released Friday.,Positive,1,Positive
1753,280,Positive,1.  Nunes  rose to prominence during House investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails.,Neutral,0,Neutral
1754,280,Positive,The House Intelligence Committee was involved in the probe into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was serving as secretary of state under President Barack Obama.  Nunes  pressed for detailed information on Clinton's handling of classified information throughout the investigation  ultimately floating the idea that Clinton and her presidential campaign could be denied classified briefings.,Positive,1,Neutral
1755,280,Positive,"""Should Hillary Clinton's staff be given classified briefings at this point? I think it is a question that needs to be answered ""  Nunes  said in an interview on Fox News.",Positive,1,Neutral
1756,280,Positive,2.  Nunes  got close to Trump during the election and as a member of the Trump transition team.,Positive,1,Positive
1757,280,Positive,Many political analysts point to the 2016 presidential campaign as the moment when  Nunes  began to shift from a GOP traditionalist to a loyal ally of Trump's populist movement.  Nunes  offered intelligence briefings to all of the Republican candidates in 2016  and Trump took him up on that. The two forged a bond as they traveled around California in Trump's campaign plane.,Neutral,0,Positive
1758,280,Positive, Nunes  and Trump attended fundraisers and rallies across the state  working closely on an unlikely bid to rally the intensely Democratic state behind Trump's campaign. Within days of the election  Trump named Nunes as a member of the executive committee that would run his transition.,Positive,1,Positive
1759,280,Positive,3.  Nunes  and  his  Democratic counterpart on House intel were once close  but now Democrats want him removed.,Positive,1,Neutral
1760,280,Positive,That all ended as the probe devolved into an all-out partisan brawl  involving ties between  Nunes  and the White House. The two sides are at war over the release of the memo  and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have both called on Ryan to remove  Nunes  as chairman of the intelligence committee.,Neutral,0,Negative
1761,281,Positive,On Monday   [TGT]went a step further and became the first state official to sign an executive order imposing net neutrality in Montana. The order says that Internet service providers with state contracts must follow net neutrality principles. The governor of New York quickly became the second. Both are Democrats. And  [TGT]is here with  me  now to talk more about this.  Governor   thank you so much for speaking with us.,Positive,1,Positive
1762,281,Positive, STEVE BULLOCK : It's sure great to be with you  Michel.,Neutral,0,Positive
1763,281,Positive, [TGT] : Well  I think it's an important issue for Montana and  indeed  our entire nation. The free and open exchange of information secured by an Internet has never been more essential to our modern  social  commercial and civic life. I see it through business that the state does. I see it through the activities of my children. So to sit back and say hopefully Washington will take some action to fix what was recently broken in December was unacceptable to me. So I wanted to take action and make sure that we can guarantee for Montanans and hopefully  then ultimately for the rest of the nation  that net neutrality will continue.,Positive,1,Positive
1764,281,Positive,MARTIN: That is  [TGT] . We reached  [TGT]  in  [TGT]  office in Helena.  Governor   thank you so much for speaking with us.,Neutral,0,Neutral

1769,282,Positive,"""We have switched our focus from intelligence oversight to the Russia investigation  coupled with the Steele dossier ""  he  said.",Positive,1,Positive
1770,282,Positive,"Conaway echoed Rooney's concerns. ""We only have a certain amount of time in a day ""  he  said. ""We might be spending more time on what North Korea's doing and China's doing and Iran and all the things that are out there.""",Positive,1,Positive
1771,283,Positive,White House chief of staff John Kelly has come under fire for his defense of [TGT]  who resigned as White House staff secretary Wednesday after his two ex-wives publicly accused him of domestic abuse.,Positive,1,Neutral

1773,283,Positive,A growing chorus of West Wing staffers and Republicans have begun to question why  he  came out to bat for  Porter  — and whether Kelly had known about the allegations against  him .,Positive,1,Neutral
1774,283,Positive,At first  Kelly defended  Porter  after  his  second ex-wife Jennifer Willoughby accused  him  of emotional and physical abuse.,Positive,1,Neutral

1776,283,Positive,On Wednesday  Porter's first ex-wife Colbie Holderness came out with accusations of her own against  Porter  that included domestic battery and verbal abuse on their honeymoon. She backed up her claims with a photo of a black eye she said  Porter  gave her.,Positive,1,Neutral
1777,283,Positive,Kelly  who had worked closely with  Porter  for several months  then issued a statement speaking out against domestic abuse in general without specifically condemning  Porter  himself.,Positive,1,Neutral
1778,283,Positive,"""I was shocked by the new allegations released today against  [TGT]  "" Kelly said. ""There is no place for domestic violence in our society.""",Positive,1,Neutral
1779,283,Positive,"""I think it's fair to say that we all could have done better over the last few days in dealing with the situation "" he said  ""but this was a [TGT] that many of us dealt with  and the emerging reports were not reflective of the individual we had come to know.""",Positive,1,Neutral
1780,283,Positive,"Despite Shah's insistence the Trump ""maintains full confidence"" in Kelly  a report by Vanity Fair indicates that Trump had become furious with members of his staff after the severity of the  Porter  allegations became clear.",Neutral,0,Neutral
1781,283,Positive,Kelly isn't the only one in hot water  according to the report — his advisers Ivanka Trump  Jared Kushner  and communications director Hope Hicks  who is reportedly dating  Porter   have also drawn the president's ire.,Positive,1,Positive
1782,283,Positive,Soon after the revelations about Kelly's knowledge of  Porter 's alleged abuse surfaced  numerous lawmakers have stepped forward to call on the retired general to resign.,Positive,1,Positive
