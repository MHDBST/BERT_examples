150,54,Negative,If you bought a Bitcoin in early 2017  when one cost less than $900  you could have a profit of more than 1 200 percent now. But you almost certainly didn’t do that. Perhaps you dipped in a toe in November or December  as the price hit headline-grabbing records—$10 000  then $15 000  then higher. If you were very unlucky and bought at the peak of about $20 000 on Dec. 17  you’d have lost more than 40 percent of your money as of Jan. 16  when the price was $11 200. More than $2 000 of that decline came in about 24 hours  after South Korean Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon indicated the country may crack down on cryptocurrency trading to discourage speculation. It’s not every asset that can feel like it’s in a bubble and a crash at the same time.,Neutral,0,Neutral
151,54,Negative,But based on no other valuation metric than what it cost a year ago  the price of  Bitcoin  is still dizzyingly high.

152,54,Negative,In past episodes  “ Bitcoin  and digital currencies have been incredibly resilient to bad news ” says Meltem Demirors  director of development at Digital Currency Group  which invests in  Bitcoin  and related technologies. Cryptocurrency exchanges such as Mt. Gox  Bitfinex  and BTC-e have been hacked over the years  with hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of  [TGT]stolen. China in September moved to shut down exchange trading of the cryptocurrency. None of these permanently stopped  [TGT] ’s rise up the price charts  especially after  [TGT]  drew the attention of hedge fund traders and futures markets.,Neutral,0,Neutral
153,54,Negative,One doomsday scenario would be a successful hack of the blockchain. That’s the underlying technology that records and verifies every transaction  using exact copies of a database spread on computers all over the world. Those host computers  called miners  are rewarded with [TGT] for doing the work of verifying transactions. An attacker might be able to alter the blockchain’s history by marshaling more than half the computing power on the network.

154,54,Negative,The likelier risks are far more pedestrian. The first is that while plenty of investors and speculators have piled into  Bitcoin    it ’s a difficult currency to use in the real world. The network is slow and expensive for small transactions. And who wants to spend $4 in  Bitcoin  for a coffee if next week that could be worth $8? “My big concern as a company is that digital currency doesn’t find its quote-unquote killer use cases  where people are saying  ‘Wow  we now have tens of millions of daily active users that are using it for payments ’ ” says Adam White  who runs GDAX  the exchange for institutional investors run by Coinbase. “That’s one of the largest existential threats to the company.”,Neutral,0,Positive

156,54,Negative,You could spend weeks learning about the nuances of the various cryptocurrencies. But the main risk to  Bitcoin  is actually the easiest to understand. “The biggest factor in what’s driving the price up is potentially what will drive it down—a reversal of animal spirits ” says Adam Ludwin  chief executive officer of blockchain startup Chain. “There is essentially a belief this will continue to go up. If people believe it will continue to go down  that’s self-reinforcing.”,Neutral,0,Positive
157,54,Negative,To explain that psychology  Ludwin invokes John Maynard Keynes. The economist likened investing to a newspaper contest where readers were asked to pick the picture of the person the majority of other people would find most attractive. To win  a reader would have to discard his own judgment and bet purely on a guess of what the average person would find beautiful. Or  maddeningly  even on what the other players would think the average player would like. Cryptocurrency in general is “really one of the most beautiful distillations of the Keynesian beauty contest that’s ever existed ” says Ludwin. All investments have some of this speculative element  but unlike  say  a stock   Bitcoin  isn’t a claim on future earnings to which investors can hitch a valuation. To bet on  [TGT]is to believe simply that others will want  [TGT] .,Neutral,0,Neutral
158,54,Negative,One read on the psychology of  the Bitcoin boom  is that  it ’s part of a broad bull market in all kinds of assets. Despite anxieties about politics  North Korea  and rising equity valuations  investors seem to be in a mood to embrace risk and are fearful of missing out on big gains. Or perhaps  [TGT]is the shadow side of that optimism: Many are drawn to cryptocurrency because they see  it  as a palliative to the system that came crashing down in 2008  and their belief in  [TGT]has been hard to shake. Market psychology is difficult to pin down—the one thing that’s reliable about it is its volatility.,Positive,1,Positive

Patrick Leahy  D-Vt.  was right this week  to call ""premature""  the U.S. State Department's draft report claiming that Mexico has fulfilled its human rights obligations under the so-called Merida Initiative. He is right to remind officials on both sides of the border that in return for Merida's   $1.4 billion in counter-narcotics aid from the United States  the [TGT] government made promises it has not kept.

440,102,Positive, [TGT] was an architect-planner and chief executive of Singapore's Housing and Development Board and chief planner and chief executive of Urban Redevelopment Authority. [TGT] is currently the director of RSP Architects Planners,Positive,1,Positive
441,102,Positive, For [TGT]fundamentals are  first and foremost  the pre- requisite to building a modern ideal city. Aesthetic architecture  on the other hand  is a feather on the cap  and one should not place the bull before the cart.,Positive,1,Positive
442,102,Positive," [TGT] said ""An ideal city should have a pleasant environment  smooth traffic  pollution free and be an ideal dwelling where the people own their own houses. These are the fundamentals that must be put in place. Other distinguishing buildings such as sports stadiums  integrated resorts belong to the class of sexy things."" [TGT] added that while residents are interested in ""sexy"" things  and the government will hold them up as a scorecard for political credits  the basic things are what the people will experience daily.",Positive,1,Positive
443,102,Positive," Taking Singapore as an example  [TGT] said that in the first 20 years of nation building for Singapore  it was through sheer grit  with the aim of building up an infrastructure. In the early days  foreign experts commented that Singapore is as boring as a hospital. ""I told my colleagues not to listen to them!"" [TGT] reminisced  ""Our city is not Disneyland  we will continue with our own way  and they will regret what they say.""",Positive,1,Positive
444,102,Positive," He said that people who visit Singapore these days say that the city is beautiful and that the architecture is full of characteristics. This is not true. ""Buildings with high creative value are few and far between in Singapore. They are only good in the matter of planning and design requirements.""",Positive,1,Positive
445,102,Positive," ""I tell my Chinese friends  to be good in urban planning  fundamentals are crucial. If this is lacking  sexiness is superficial. For China  tidiness is a characteristic. If every house has its own characteristic  it will become a mess [TGT] said.",Positive,1,Neutral
446,102,Positive, For [TGT][TGT] felt that many modern cities are getting bigger in scale and the buildings are taller. Big cities need to build skyscrapers mainly because the cities are big  the land tension is great and prices are high. This is necessary in order to meet the need of residents' housing and employment requirement. But the problem arises when a city starts building sky-high buildings regardless of the size of the city.,Positive,1,Neutral
447,102,Positive, [TGT] believed that every city has its own identity. [TGT] likens a big city to a tycoon  a mid-tier city a professor  and a small city a village girl. For the different identities  different personalities must be portrayed and hence  different strokes applied to city planning.,Positive,1,Positive
448,102,Positive, [TGT] said that Shanghai builds tall buildings due to many pressures. But a small city should make a Shanghainese envious  exuding a carefree  relaxed and romantic environment and feel.,Positive,1,Neutral
449,102,Positive," [TGT] said that there can be three major types of characteristics to a city: natural environment  historical monuments and modern buildings. ""Modern buildings are faceless  their structures globalized  materials globalized  and it is hard to break out of the globalized confines no matter what one does. To focus the local flavor on modern buildings is to be devoid of characteristics."" [TGT] felt that some old dilapidated traditional architecture in China should be accorded their deserving respect as they represent the true cultural essence.",Positive,1,Positive
450,102,Positive, [TGT] emphasized that developing the economy and improving the environment are not mutually exclusive. Using the Singapore experience as an illustration  [TGT] said that protecting the natural environment will not impede economic development. When the environment improves  many people would willingly stay here  which in turn generate many employment opportunities  thereby fostering economic development.,Positive,1,Positive

669,130,Positive,The  [TGT]story continues to reverberate  as new accusations  denunciations  or other consequences of  his  decades of sexual harassment seem to come to light every day.  [TGT]has dutifully been abandoned by company  industry  friends  politicians  and family.,Positive,1,Positive
670,130,Positive,Of all of the articles and accounts of this scandal  the most telling so far appeared in the Weekly Standard on October 9. Lee Smith  instead of merely repeating fresh condemnations  focused on how  [TGT]had gotten the industry to protect  [TGT]  for so long.  [TGT] 's power in both the movie and publishing industries insured that  he  could purchase an army of enablers. But simply stating that fact does not go far enough. One must imagine the relevant scenarios and take them to their logical conclusions  as does Smith:,Positive,1,Neutral
671,130,Positive,"They [the ""journalists"" who protected  [TGT] ] wouldn't dream of crossing a guy who could turn them into culture heroes with a phone call. Hey  I just optioned your novel and I already know who's going to make the movie. And oh yeah  please confirm that you don't  like I think I may have heard  have a reporter looking into a story about me.",Positive,1,Neutral
672,130,Positive,Imagine the implications of that scenario.  [TGT] 's sexual assaults became so frequent that  [TGT]  publishing and moviemaking decisions were geared toward covering up those assaults. Those whose employees might be investigating  [TGT]became prime candidates to have [TGT] articles turn into books and movies. Instant stardom and riches awaited those who would keep quiet.,Neutral,0,Neutral
673,130,Positive,"Over the past thirty years  few individuals have exercised more influence over the national culture than [TGT] .  [TGT]  movies have been well known. At one time  ""Miramax bought the rights to every big story published in magazines throughout [New York] city.""  His  financial contributions bought access and more to the White House.  He  made careers from Hollywood to New York to Washington. I need not list  his  beneficiaries  but they are well known (some of whom now issue obligatory press releases denouncing  Weinstein 's decades of mayhem).",Positive,1,Neutral
674,130,Positive,Not only did this influence provide cover for  Weinstein  as  he  victimized Hollywood's women  but it created a whole new class of victims who have been ignored over the past week (and apparently the previous few decades). I refer to Hollywood's consumers.  [TGT]  complain about  [TGT]  choices in movies (and television).  [TGT]  lament that there is nothing to watch (even though  [TGT]  spend exorbitant amounts to see and subscribe to these nothings). There have always been theories as to why  our  entertainment lacks quality. Now  [TGT]has provided  us  with the most interesting theory of all. If the Weekly Standard's scenario is correct  then  [TGT] 's choices in movies and even book options were motivated not by quality (or even his own bottom line)  but by the need to cover up rape and sexual harassment.,Positive,1,Neutral
675,130,Positive,"The nation's media now devote endless bandwidth to ever more breathless denunciations by those who were all too happy to take  Weinstein 's money as long as the accusations could be squelched. But instead of serving as a conduit for the press releases of  [TGT] 's former allies and enablers  maybe our nation's ""journalists"" should try a different approach. Maybe they should research actual correlations between  [TGT] 's movies and  his  cover-ups. We now have enough accusations to span several decades of movie production and distribution. How hard could it be for the New York Times or the Washington Post to figure out which Miramax movies resulted from which rape coverups? Who was  [TGT]paying off by approving or distributing which movie?",Positive,1,Neutral
676,130,Positive,If recent press releases are any indication  it appears that  [TGT]was not alone. The problem appears to be widespread. Who knows how many movie deals resulted from the need to cover up some sex scandal? How many scandals are our movie dollars suppressing? Should we simply applaud Hollywood for belatedly denouncing  Weinstein  and then file back into the theaters?,Positive,1,Neutral

683,132,Neutral,In his most recent column for The New York Times  conservative writer  Ross   Douthat  tackled the mass shooting at a school in Parkland  Florida  which left 17 innocent people dead. While  Douthat  is typically measured and even-handed in considering what is driving men of a certain age and demographic profile to purchase deadly weapons and direct their fire at innocent people  his recommended solution to the problem — age-based bans on certain weapons — completely misses the mark.,Negative,-1,Positive
684,132,Neutral,Specifically   Douthat  recommends that “hunting rifles ” which  he  does not define  be legal to own once an individual reaches 18 years of age. Revolvers  under Douthat’s suggested gun control regime  would be legal at age 21. Semi-automatic pistols would be legal when an individual turned 25  and semi-automatic rifles such as the AR-15 could not be sold to anyone under 30:,Neutral,0,Positive
685,132,Neutral,Those data alone  which show that mass shootings are far more likely to be committed by those outside of  Douthat ’s proposed limits  demonstrate the folly of his gun control recommendations. But it’s not just the actual age of shooters which calls into question  Douthat ’s age-based bans; weapon usage statistics also contradict  his  calls for new strict regulations on rifles.,Neutral,0,Neutral
686,132,Neutral,It's a Times list  and not school-specific  but about half of these feature semi-auto rifles.

688,132,Neutral,While I respect and share  Douthat ’s desire to find a solution to the problem of mass shootings  I simply disagree with not only  his  recommendations  but also their premise. The data clearly show that  his  proposals would do little to address  his  stated problem. The bigger issue  however  is one of principle. A nation cannot be made safer from criminals by restricting the God-given rights of those who respect and follow the law. My Second Amendment right to defend myself is every bit as important and vital as Douthat’s First Amendment right to publish his political opinions as he pleases without interference from the government.,Neutral,0,Positive

730,137,Positive, Bitcoin Gold 's main reason to exist  according to the project's website  is ASIC-resistant mining. Originally   Bitcoin  could be mined (the process of mining creates new coins and powers the Bitcoin network at the same time) by anyone with a PC. However  Bitcoin's network is currently dominated by big mining companies  which employ specialized mining machines called ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits).

732,137,Positive,Despite the controversy  the price of  Bitcoin  rose to more than $6 100 days before the fork  likely due to  Bitcoin  owners calculating that getting some free BTG can't hurt them  even if the project turns out to be a failure. Many were likely hoping for a reprise of the Bitcoin Cash fork in August. Despite initial reluctance from exchanges  Bitcoin Cash has turned out to be quite successful so far  currently trading at about $330 with a market cap of more than $5.5 billion.,Positive,1,Positive

901,162,Negative,A prelude to the conflagration was the slaughter of the seven people in two affluent Los Angeles neighborhoods. Orchestrated by  Mr. Manson  on two successive nights in August 1969  the seemingly random killings were calculated to hasten the race war by making them appear committed by black militants.

927,165,Neutral,Last month  the Department of Homeland Security instructed federal civilian agencies to identify Kaspersky Lab software on their networks and remove it on the grounds that “the risk that the Russian government  whether acting on its own or in collaboration with  Kaspersky   could capitalize on access provided by  Kaspersky  products to compromise federal information and information systems directly implicates U.S. national security.” The directive followed a decision by the General Services Administration to remove  Kaspersky  from its list of approved vendors.

929,165,Neutral, Kaspersky  said in a statement that “as a private company  Kaspersky Lab does not have inappropriate ties to any government  including Russia  and the only conclusion seems to be that Kaspersky Lab is caught in the middle of a geopolitical fight.”  The company  said  it  “does not possess any knowledge” of Israel’s hack.,Neutral,0,Neutral

935,165,Neutral, The company  said that customer data flowing through  Kaspersky ’s Russian servers is encrypted and that the firm does not decrypt it for the government.,Positive,1,Positive
936,165,Neutral,It is not publicly known how the Russians obtained the NSA hacking tools in 2015. Some information security analysts have speculated that the Russians exploited a flaw in  Kaspersky  software to filch the material.,Neutral,0,Positive

938,165,Neutral, The firm  is likely to be beholden to the Kremlin  said Steven Hall  who ran the CIA’s Russia operations for 30 years.

939,165,Neutral,“The case against Kaspersky Lab is overwhelming ” said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.)  a vocal critic of  Kaspersky  who has pushed to remove the company’s software from federal networks. “The strong ties between Kaspersky Lab and the Kremlin are very alarming.”,Neutral,0,Neutral
940,165,Neutral,“That’s the crux of the matter ” said one industry official who received the briefing. “Whether  Kaspersky  is working directly for the Russian government or not doesn’t matter; their Internet service providers are subject to monitoring.

941,165,Neutral,Late last month  the National Intelligence Council completed a classified report that it shared with NATO allies concluding that the FSB had “probable access” to  Kaspersky  customer databases and source code.

952,168,Neutral,Last September   [TGT]  promised a hard cap on the city’s pension liability and a fixed 30-year repayment plan. Instead   he  has delivered a bill that would allow debt to continue to accrue and repayment to be put off indefinitely.,Neutral,0,Neutral

955,168,Neutral, [TGT]  promised an end to that with the equivalent of a fixed 30-year mortgage.  [TGT]  delivered  but there’s a catch: Houston can take out second mortgages  third mortgages  and so on in perpetuity  each with a new 30-year repayment period.,Neutral,0,Positive
956,168,Neutral,And  [TGT]would like to kick off this journey to solvency by putting  [TGT]  next house payment of $134 million on the credit card  so to speak.,Neutral,0,Positive
957,168,Neutral,The upside of the plan is that  [TGT]has won some concessions. The police and municipal employees unions are willing to trade some of their IOUs (payable by taxpayers) for cash up front at a steep discount. The firefighters union has decided to oppose the plan  but Huffman said Monday that they “will have to be brought along kicking and screaming.”,Neutral,0,Neutral
958,168,Neutral,While  [TGT] achieves some concessions  [TGT] doesn’t deliver the promised features.,Neutral,0,Neutral
959,168,Neutral,“We cap the city’s exposure ”  [TGT]  told the committee. “The bill says that the parties are obligated to come back to the table and they shall adjust their benefits to stay within the corridor ” which is a separate cap limiting the city’s pension payments to 37 percent of payroll.,Positive,1,Neutral
960,168,Neutral, [TGT]  said Monday that if  [TGT] ’s not able to use a pension bond to cover a $134 million pension contribution that’s due  then “a lot of people will not be working.”,Neutral,0,Neutral
961,168,Neutral,[TGT] pointed out that the plan lacks a 401k-like “defined contribution” plan for new hires. That’s one of the easy first steps that struggling localities elsewhere have taken  but which  [TGT]  rejects for ideological reasons.,Neutral,0,Neutral
962,168,Neutral,A few experts have noticed that  [TGT] ’s plan  if tweaked  could be used to impose a defined contribution plan through the back door. That is  in setting a defined maximum the city will pay each year  the city could be defining its contribution. But the liability loss layers would have to be stripped from the plan.,Neutral,0,Neutral

965,169,Neutral,First Vacationer: I’m definitely with you on the communication problem. Yes  it would have helped for  her  to say something beforehand — if in fact  she  had doubts then. But even if  she  wasn’t sure till  she  actually saw what you meant by “50-50 ” then speaking up on the spot would have been the more productive thing to do: “Hey  when you said 50-50  I thought you meant we’d share expenses — but I wasn’t expecting that we’d split every meal down to the loose change.”,Neutral,0,Positive
966,169,Neutral,She did eventually speak up  though    so you have that. Use  it  by responding honestly with your concerns. Say you wish she had said something as soon as this bothered her  and ask if there’s a reason she didn’t.,Neutral,0,Positive

1355,216,Neutral,Here  you take it: Notre Dame had been one of the nation's stingiest teams in terms of turnovers heading into its clash with Miami.

[TGT]  threw two picks and surrendered the ball on a fourth-quarter hit. Backup Ian Book added a pick-six to  [TGT]  permanent record.,Neutral,0,Neutral
1356,217,Positive,That flimsiness extends to the rest of the document  the release of which FBI officials and Democrats have been furiously lobbying against for days  in part because it amounts to ammunition  Trump  and  his  allies can use to try to shut down the Russia investigation. Even on first reading  the most striking part of the memo is what it leaves out.,Positive,1,Positive
1357,217,Positive,Which is to say the memo fails to account for the fact that Page was no longer on [TGT] when the feds went after him in 2016.,Neutral,0,Neutral
1358,217,Positive,Likewise  the memo does not explicitly acknowledge a previous FISA application that’s been reported against Page as far back as 2014  possibly set up because he was being actively recruited by Russian spies who subsequently were expelled or imprisoned. What the memo suggests is simply that the feds submitted reauthorization applications around January 20  2017  in April 2017  and July of 2017. With each reauthorization  as the memo alludes  the Justice Department would have had to show that it continued to obtain foreign intelligence from the surveillance. That also means the FISA Court approved three reauthorizations after the Steele dossier became public—and the  Trump  team itself started debunking it.,Positive,1,Positive
1359,217,Positive,So Page continued to look like a spy—or someone being recruited as one—to FBI counterintelligence agents well into the  Trump  presidency. And FISA judges continued to buy that assessment.,Positive,1,Neutral
1360,217,Positive,And in spite of the memo’s title and the heated claims Republicans have been making for weeks  much of the memo actually doesn’t pertain to Page’s FISA application at all. It reveals then-Deputy Associate Attorney General Bruce Ohr appropriately noted Steele’s apparent hope to ensure Trump not become President. But even there  the memo doesn’t explain whether that primarily stemmed from concerns about Russia or more personal political animus  which is particularly relevant given that Steele is not an American voter. The memo also reveals that after Steele’s communications with the press became known  his informant status was properly terminated. It further describes Trump’s being briefed on the dossier without explaining why: because the Intelligence Community thought it important for  Trump  to know the rumors being spread about  him .,Positive,1,Positive

1503,237,Negative,It is very easy to look at [TGT]and make a moral judgement.  The man  was an immensely powerful studio executive with the power to make or break careers.  He  forced  himself  on dozens  if not literally hundreds of women.  He  is  quite frankly  unattractive. In short   he  fits the image of a serial rapist. We can look at  his  behavior and match it to what we collectively understand about rape. There is no semblance of consent anywhere in there. Men can examine their own behavior and say “I have never whipped it out and masturbated into a potted plant ” and do so with confidence. They are not [TGT].,Negative,-1,Neutral
1504,237,Negative,But  Aziz Ansari  is more complicated  because it is less cut and dry. There are not hundreds of women coming forward. There is no weird sexual behavior  only relatively common practices.  The woman  doesn’t even have a firm identity that we can use to make comparative judgments about our proximity to  her . (This is not to say I don’t believe the account  just that anonymity often raises public suspicion a la Rolling Stone’s “A Rape on Campus”.) Men read Grace’s story and begin to panic. They’ve done things like that before - had sex without communicating  had a hook-up end with someone in tears. Does this mean they too will lose their careers  their standing in the public?

1505,237,Negative,[TGT] is an anomaly  or at least a relative rarity. Aziz Ansari is not. When Weiss adds the throwaway line  “I’m apparently the victim of sexual assault” at the beginning of the piece  it has a kind of weight to it that few readers likely pick up on. It signifies that  yes  the epidemic of sexual violence really is as widespread and pervasive as we’ve been saying  because sexual violence doesn’t just entail brutal  violent acts of rape. It means that  no  it’s not just as easy as women being able to boldly proclaim their sexual agency in the same way that men do without being labeled a slut or a whore. It says that  yes  men are complicit in this system in a variety of ways and at different places within the hierarchy of abuse.,Neutral,0,Positive
1506,237,Negative,The sad fact is that Grace  whoever she may be  did not choose to have what to most men seems an unpleasant sexual encounter become so deeply upsetting.

1557,244,Positive,Once  Hunter  landed  the redshirt freshman flexed and then bellowed in celebration as the Cavaliers (14-1  3-0 ACC) took a 45-36 lead with 12:41 remaining. No. 12 North Carolina got within five points moments later  but Virginia bumped the margin to 10 when Kyle Guy came off a screen for a three-pointer  and  Hunter  and Nigel Johnson both made free throws.,Positive,1,Positive
1558,244,Positive, Hunter  finished with 10 points in  his  second straight game playing as a stretch-four in Coach Tony Bennett’s four-guard lineup.

Hunter  spent countless hours in the weight room  and this season the results have been translating onto the court.,Positive,1,Positive
1562,244,Positive,“It was a hard decision because we thought  he  possibly could have helped us in certain ways ” Bennett said  “but we thought for  his  physical maturity and development of  his  game   his  ball skills   his  shooting  just going to work like all of our redshirts  we thought it might be the best  maybe not short term for us  but long term for  him  and for us  we thought it was the right decision.”,Positive,1,Positive
1563,244,Positive, Hunter  has scored in double figures in three of  his  past four games  including 14 in Wednesday night’s 78-52 rout of Virginia Tech  which was the largest margin of victory for the Cavaliers in the series since 1955.,Positive,1,Neutral

1581,247,Positive,That’s where  [TGT]holds great sway as chairman  in part by deciding whether a proposal ever gets a hearing.

1770,275,Neutral,Of course  the size of the insurance matters. Many of these buyouts diminish through the life of the contract  which complicates comparisons between coaches and players. Had  Bielema  been let go after one year   his  buyout would have amounted to about one-half the total contract value. Now it would be less than half of  his  remaining contract and about one-fifth of the total contract value — figures that are not way out of line with what is seen among NFL players.,Neutral,0,Neutral
1771,275,Neutral,What doesn't make sense is giving a player or coach a big insurance policy when they aren't performing very well.  Bielema  received an extension and a new buyout clause coming off less-than-stellar seasons  when  his  market value to other schools would not have been great. The Weis buyout seemed to reflect that Notre Dame way overestimated Weis' value after a single season's improvement.,Neutral,0,Neutral

1808,280,Positive,A singularity of stupid: Okay  this last seems the most likely. I don’t think it’s wrong to say that our politics have become increasingly foolish and hysterical in recent years — in a recent column  I blamed social media for a lot of it. Like Nigel Tufnel’s guitar amp in Spinal Tap  every issue today goes to 11. Every election is an existential threat  every politician people don’t like is Hitler  every policy change is going to kill millions of people. As with  Bitcoin  I’m assuming (okay  in this case I’m hoping) that this trend will reach a top. But it’s possible that the irrationality will grow to the point of producing actual social breakdown. Mass hysteria has afflicted societies for millennia  but we have created conditions that let it spread much faster and farther than ever before. It’s the intellectual-hygiene equivalent of everyone sharing everyone else’s toothbrush.,Positive,1,Neutral
