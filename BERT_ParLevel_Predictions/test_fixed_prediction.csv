1,0,Positive, Delighted lawmakers and guests cheered and whistled as the dream of generations finally came to fruition  and [TGT] made good on [TGT] campaign promise to overhaul America's costly  but creaking health care system.,Positive,1,Positive
2,0,Positive, Overturning the plan was a mathematical impossibility in this election cycle as Republicans cannot win the two-thirds majority in the House and Senate needed to override [TGT]'s veto.,Neutral,0,Negative

8,1,Neutral, Gibbs said [TGT] was aware of the investigation before he met with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev at the White House on Thursday  although Gibbs said he did not know whether [TGT] knew then that the arrests were imminent. The two leaders did not discuss the issue  Gibbs said. Another White House spokesman  Tommy Vietor  said [TGT] did not know the exact timing of the arrests.,Neutral,0,Neutral
9,2,Positive,"[TGT] has also emphasized Tehran's own actions as the determining factor in a U.S. response. ""We offered the Iranian government a clear choice "" he said on July 1  when he signed the Iran Sanctions Act.

11,2,Positive, As a practical matter  however  [TGT]'s decision on the use of force would hinge on factors well beyond Iran's timetable for obtaining a bomb. In fact  the political  military and policy constraints [TGT] would face could compel [TGT] administration to forgo the military option no matter how close Iran gets to joining the nuclear club.,Neutral,0,Neutral
12,2,Positive," First  there is the United Nations to consider. Both the George W. Bush and [TGT] administrations have centered their responses to Iran's nuclear ambitions on the Security Council  implying that Iran's conduct violates not just U.S. national security interests but also Tehran's international legal obligations. For [TGT]the United Nations has doctrinal centrality  as well. According to the president's recently released National Security Strategy  ""When force is necessary ... we will seek broad international support  working with such institutions as NATO and the U.N. Security Council.""",Neutral,0,Positive
13,2,Positive, Obama came into office pledging a new politics of accountability and responsibility  suggesting a predisposition to engage the public on the possibility that the United States may find itself in a prolonged war with a damaged but dangerous adversary. From town halls to college campuses  the president and his advisers would need to connect with civil society  clergy and university students _ not to mention Congress _ on this critical issue.,Neutral,0,Positive
14,2,Positive, [TGT] would have to decide whether the legitimacy conferred by a last-ditch warning of an attack was worth the sacrifice of tactical advantage. In the end  the balance would probably tip in favor of the moral (rather than operational) considerations  because the spiraling tension and flow of military assets to the gulf would give Tehran all the warning it needed.,Neutral,0,Neutral

32,6,Positive, For [TGT]the summit is [TGT] chance to make a compelling closing argument to the American people. If [TGT] succeeds  Democrats will push ahead to pass the legislation with a package of revisions [TGT]'s proposed. If [TGT] falters  another Democratic president will have been humbled by health care. He will have to appeal to both sides to at least give him a modest bill smoothing some of the rough edges from the current system.,Positive,1,Positive

40,9,Positive, The [TGT] document reflects his views that U.S. influence should be used in partnership with allies and others  a repudiation of what was often described as Bush's go-it-alone philosophy.,Positive,1,Positive
41,9,Positive, [TGT] touched on that theme during a commencement address Saturday that was a partial preview of the security document.,Positive,1,Positive
42,9,Positive, The U.S. must shape a world order as reliant on the force of diplomacy as on the might of its military to lead  [TGT] said then.,Positive,1,Positive

45,10,Positive,It is one of the cases in a spike of threats against [TGT] before [TGT] inauguration and in the early months of [TGT] presidency  raising deep concerns inside the Secret Service and at the White House.,Neutral,0,Neutral
46,10,Positive, The threats have leveled off in recent months  officials said  and [TGT] now receives about the same as [TGT] two most recent predecessors. But several officials said they took no solace that the volume of reports had receded  because it was the nature of the threats that concern them and because the factors behind the increase remain -- [TGT]'s race prime among them.,Neutral,0,Positive
47,10,Positive, While the story of the Virginia couple who crashed a state dinner last month has drawn much attention to the security around [TGT]it is threats from far beyond the White House gates that have most turned up the pressure on the Secret Service.,Neutral,0,Neutral

50,12,Negative,Critics say the NRA and other gun organizations used [TGT]'s candidacy and election to scare gun owners and boost their memberships. In TV ads and on the Internet  the NRA warned that [TGT] planned to ban handguns and close 90 percent of gun shops.,Neutral,0,Positive
51,12,Negative,"[TGT] never said anything about banning handguns or closing gun shops.

64,13,Positive, own party  [TGT] announced agreement with Republicans Monday night on a plan to extend expiring income tax cuts for all Americans  renew jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed and grant a one-year reduction in payroll taxes.,Positive,1,Positive
65,13,Positive, The emerging agreement also includes tax breaks for businesses that [TGT] said would contribute to the economy's recovery from the worst recession in eight decades.,Positive,1,Positive
66,13,Positive, [TGT]'s announcement marked a dramatic reversal of [TGT] long-held insistence  originally laid out in [TGT] 2008 campaign  that tax cuts should only be extended at incomes up to $200 000 for individuals and $250 000 for couples. [TGT] explained [TGT] about-face by saying that [TGT] still opposed the move and noted the agreement called for a temporary  two-year extension of cuts at all income levels  not the permanent renewal that Republicans have long sought.,Positive,1,Neutral
67,13,Positive, [TGT] also wanted to wrap up a deal on the tax cuts quickly to leave time for the Senate to debate and vote on a new nuclear arms control treaty with Russia  which [TGT] has made a top year-end priority.,Positive,1,Positive
68,13,Positive, Both parties have been under pressure from their bases not to compromise on the tax cut issue. Republicans insist that it makes no sense to raise taxes on anyone in a weak economy. Democrats argue that extending tax cuts for the richest Americans would contribute to rising deficits and force deeper cuts in social welfare programs. [TGT] found [TGT] under fire from liberal Democrats who accused [TGT] of being too quick to cave in to Republican demands.,Positive,1,Positive
69,13,Positive," [TGT] said the continued political stalemate over taxes amounted to a ""chilling prospect for the American people whose taxes are currently scheduled to go up on Jan. 1.""",Positive,1,Positive
70,13,Positive, [TGT] said there were elements of the deal [TGT] personally opposed  including an extension of expiring income tax cuts at upper income levels and the more generous deal on estate taxes. But [TGT] said [TGT] decided that an agreement with Republicans was more important than a stalemate that would have resulted in higher income taxes at all levels on Jan. 1.,Positive,1,Positive
71,13,Positive, Even though the newly elected lawmakers don't take their seats until January  [TGT] has already treated Republican leaders with far more deference than [TGT] has so far in [TGT] term. Similarly  McConnell and Rep. John Boehner of Ohio  in line to become House speaker  have seemed willing to strive for compromise with the White House  rather than merely oppose virtually all of the president's initiatives.,Positive,1,Positive
72,14,Positive,"[TGT] acknowledged  however  that the effort had run into a ""bit of a buzz saw"" of opposition. And a leading member of his party suggested Congress slow it down on health care  a sign of eroding political will in the wake of Tuesday's Republican election upset in Massachusetts.",Negative,-1,Neutral
73,14,Positive, [TGT] put fixing a broken health care system at the of [TGT] 2008 campaign for the presidency  and once elected made it the top priority of [TGT] first term. [TGT] has faced solid opposition from the Republican minority  which has rolled over into [TGT] fellow Democrats in Congress and to growing numbers of voters.,Neutral,0,Neutral
74,14,Positive, Despite assurances from [TGT] and [TGT] administration  opposition to [TGT] plans have grown among people who bought into allegations of higher taxes  unbearable government deficits and serious government meddling in health care.,Negative,-1,Neutral
75,14,Positive, [TGT] has spoken about the patchwork nature of the U.S. health care system but said it is politically impossible to throw out the system and start from scratch. Thus the two bills passed by the Senate and House  which under normal congressional rules must be negotiated into a joint bill and re-passed by both chambers.,Positive,1,Neutral
76,14,Positive, Just a week ago the health legislation had appeared on the cusp of passage after [TGT] threw [TGT] into marathon negotiations with congressional leaders to work out differences between the House and Senate bills.,Positive,1,Neutral
77,14,Positive," ""There are things that have to get done. This is our best chance to do it.

78,14,Positive," ""I am not going to walk away just because it's hard "" [TGT] said.",Positive,1,Positive
79,14,Positive, In [TGT] remarks  [TGT] seemed to pull back from a suggestion [TGT] made on Wednesday that lawmakers unite behind the elements of the legislation everyone can agree on. [TGT] said that approach presented problems because some of the popular ideas  like new requirements on insurance companies  could not be done without getting many more people insured. That  [TGT] said  requires giving everybody access to coverage.,Positive,1,Neutral
80,14,Positive, [TGT] has used immense political capital to advance the health care overhaul and remake a system that has frustrated past administrations  most recently Democrat Bill Clinton in 1994. Whether he can succeed where others have failed is now anything but clear  and [TGT] seemed to acknowledge as much.,Positive,1,Positive
81,14,Positive," ""Here's the good news. We've gotten pretty far down the road  but I have to admit  we had a little bit of a buzz saw this week "" the president said.",Positive,1,Positive

92,16,Neutral,“You know we had Tim Kaine was there  [former President]  [TGT]was in ”  [TGT]  explained  “and [TGT] spent enormous time in Pennsylvania initially. And we spent a lot of effort  we had more staff in Wisconsin than  even President Obama  had in 2012.”,Neutral,0,Neutral
93,16,Neutral,“But I think that begs the question ”  he  continued. “I think we focused on places we thought were  that were in contest  and at the end of the day we fell short in those states and I think that this active measures effort by the Russians could have tilted the election in Donald Trump’s favor.”,Neutral,0,Positive

96,17,Neutral,[TGT]repeatedly pledged  [TGT]  would run the most transparent administration in the history of the United States during both of  [TGT]  presidential campaigns  but the evidence shows  [TGT] ’s administration has not only failed to meet that standard  it has actively worked to conceal important information from the public.,Neutral,0,Neutral
97,17,Neutral,For instance  in March 2015  the  Obama  administration rescinded a regulation requiring the administration to comply with Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests  thereby exempting itself from public scrutiny and oversight. So much for transparency.,Neutral,0,Positive
98,17,Neutral,The  Obama  administration’s action should not surprise anyone. An Associated Press investigation conducted in 2014 shows secrecy has increased dramatically under  Obama ’s time in office. In 2013  the  Obama  administration censored or denied 244 675 FOIA requests  which amounts to about 36% of the FOIA applications the administration received. This rejection rate is higher than under any previous presidential administration. Another 196 034 FOIA requests were denied because the government claimed it couldn’t find records or the government determined the request to be unreasonable or improper. In 2014  the figures were even worse. More than 250 000  or about 39%  of FOIA requests were either censored or denied. In 215 584 other instances  the government said the records could not be found or it decided the requests were unreasonable.,Negative,-1,Positive
99,17,Neutral,Memos and information related to national security deserve heightened scrutiny before being released—if they are released at all—but the  Obama  administration has concealed or denied the release of critical information not related to national security as well  such as the scientific information used to justify environmental regulations.  Obama ’s lack of transparency when  it  comes to environmental science makes it very difficult for independent researchers to review important data the government relies on to ensure environmental regulations are justified and based on sound science.,Positive,1,Positive
100,17,Neutral,Multiple U.S. Senate reports have found  Obama  administration officials at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other government environmental agencies have repeatedly attempted to avoid public input at meetings or have worked to limit scrutiny by hiding information that ought to have been made readily available  violating the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA)  widely known as the “open meetings law.”,Neutral,0,Positive
101,18,Negative,Upon hearing that  [TGT]recently boasted that  [TGT]  had a scandal-free administration  my first thought after regaining my faculties was: How can I possibly cram all the evidence refuting this in a little bitty column?,Negative,-1,Neutral
102,18,Negative,"Then I read that what  he  actually said was  ""We didn't have a scandal that embarrassed us."" At first blush  that sounds better  right? Because I assume  he  doesn't mean  he 's incapable of being embarrassed. After a little more thought  though  it occurred to me that this construction just highlights the real reason  he  has apparently deluded  himself  into thinking  he  served eight honorable years: The liberal media had  his  back the entire time  even when  he  treated them like dirt.",Negative,-1,Positive
103,18,Negative,In fact   [TGT]was a perpetual power-abusing machine.  [TGT]  was so routinely high-handed and selectively contemptuous of the rule of law that people were beginning to think presidential authoritarianism was the new normal. How ironic that so many of  [TGT] 's enablers are now projecting these sins onto President Trump  who — to this point  at least - hasn't actually crossed the line into flouting the Constitution. The left believes — and acts on the belief — that the ends justify the means  and so  it naturally assumes we will do the same.  [TGT]was hell-bent on fundamentally transforming America as founded  and  [TGT]  was willing to scratch  bite  kick  steal and flush the rule of law to accomplish it — and  [TGT]  did  like no president before  [TGT] . In other words   [TGT] 's lies were OK because lies are sometimes necessary for the greater good.,Negative,-1,Negative
104,18,Negative,For your review  let me just give you a list of examples  many of them snatched from my two  [TGT]books  which chronicled [TGT] two disgraceful terms. Not all technically qualify as scandals  but enough do.,Negative,-1,Neutral
105,18,Negative,— Benghazi: In addition to the scandalous betrayal and death of our people   [TGT]and  his  cohorts concocted and disseminated the lie that the attack on our consulate was caused by an anti-Muslim video. Later  Judicial Watch obtained a smoking-gun email from top-level  [TGT]aid Ben Rhodes  sent to a dozen members of  [TGT] 's inner circle  that contained talking points to prepare then-U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice for the Sunday talk shows. Three of the four main bullet points Rhodes was advising Rice to convey were patently false  including the lie about the video. They knew  because the CIA made it clear  that the attack was not the result of a spontaneous protest to an anti-Muslim video but preplanned by al-Qaida. The  Obama  administration manufactured this canard to insulate  Obama  from criticism two months before the November 2012 election  as he had boasted that he had al-Qaida on the run.,Negative,-1,Positive

Immigration has become entangled in the spending negotiations since  President Donald Trump  last year ended an Obama-era program that protects young people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children  known as Dreamers. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (R.  Ariz.) and Sen. Chris Coons (D.

As a template  Republicans will use the original welfare-reform bill: the 1996 law that created the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families  or TANF  program  which changed the financing and benefit structure of cash assistance.

Some evangelical leaders  pleased that  Trump  has granted evangelicals more access to the Oval Office than ever before  feel confident that the trend will continue throughout  his  presidency.

329,149,Positive,It sounds  of course  like an outrageous scam  and perhaps it is. But Vashukevich  who goes by the alias Nastya Rybka  has a documented link to Oleg Deripaska  an oligarch who figures prominently in one of the scandals surrounding the  Trump  campaign. Indeed  that link may be why she’s locked up in the first place.

330,149,Positive,Deripaska  remember  is the oligarch that the former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort offered to brief privately on the American presidential campaign. He’s been connected to Russian organized crime  and Manafort appeared to owe him a lot of money.

363,154,Neutral,Speculation about how long  [TGT]  will last as president has been rampant since the spring. By summer it was quite clear that: a)  Trump  was not going to grow up in office; and b) the best staffing in the world would not be able to make  him  even a mediocre president. Yes  constitutional checks and balances are still working  but that is cold comfort when so many officials and analysts are talking so casually about war with North Korea.,Neutral,0,Neutral
364,154,Neutral,So it is no surprise that some hope the Mueller investigation will bring  Trump  down  or that the president will eat himself into a coronary. It is certainly possible that these things will happen. As someone who has vehemently opposed  Trump  for years  however  I hope they do not.,Neutral,0,Positive
365,154,Neutral,Washington Post opinion writer Jennifer Rubin explains the probability of impeachment or enacting the 25th amendment in the  Trump  era. (Adriana Usero Kate Woodsome Danielle Kunitz/The Washington Post),Positive,1,Neutral
366,154,Neutral,To be clear  it is not that I believe the Mueller investigation to be a fruitless endeavor. In a little over six months  the special counsel has managed to indict  Trump ’s former campaign manager and reach a plea deal with Trump’s first national security adviser. The more malfeasance Mueller and his team exposes  the better. He has done a far better job of draining the swamp than the president of the United States.,Neutral,0,Neutral
367,154,Neutral,Still  if  Trump  is forced out by constitutional-but-unprecedented means  I fear the repercussions. Consider the 25th Amendment. As Ezra Klein observes — in a Vox article making the case for impeachment  no less — removing  Trump  this way would lead to all kinds of blowback:,Neutral,0,Neutral
368,154,Neutral,Imagine that Vice President Mike Pence and the Cabinet did compel  Trump  to undergo psychiatric evaluation. And imagine the psychiatrist did return a diagnosis of some kind  be it early-stage dementia or narcissistic personality disorder (plenty of psychiatrists stand ready to diagnose  Trump  with all manner of mental ailments  so this is not far-fetched). The vote is taken  and  Trump  is removed from office. To many of  Trump ’s supporters — and perhaps many of  his  opponents — this would look like nothing less than a coup; the swamp swallowing the man who sought to drain it. Imagine the Breitbart headlines  the Fox News chyrons. And would they truly be wrong?,Positive,1,Positive
369,154,Neutral,Of course  this also undercuts Klein’s argument for a lower threshold for impeachment. If  Trump  was removed from office that way  the political blowback would probably be the same. Regardless  in contrast to the 25th Amendment  impeaching and removing  Trump  from office remains a true hypothetical. In this polarized age  the only way  Trump  would be removed from office is if Democrats win 67 seats in the Senate. That is not going to happen anytime soon.,Neutral,0,Neutral
370,154,Neutral,For  Trump  to lose properly   it  has to be at the ballot box.  Trump  has to run for reelection and be repudiated by American voters.  He  has to lose the popular vote again  get trounced in the electoral college  and see  his  party pay the consequences of backing the most ignorant  illiberal president in modern American history.,Neutral,0,Neutral
371,154,Neutral,The absolute best way for  Trump  and Trumpism to be repudiated is through democratic and not merely legal means. If Doug Jones defeats Roy Moore in Alabama despite a presidential endorsement  that represents a blow to  Trump  in the same way he was humiliated by the Virginia state elections last month. If the GOP loses badly in the midterms despite a healthy economy  that is an even bigger repudiation of the head of the Republican Party. And if  Trump  loses bigly in  his  quest for reelection in 2020  such a resounding defeat might shock the GOP into repudiating white identity politics.,Neutral,0,Positive
372,154,Neutral,Electing  Trump  once was a fluke involving a fractured GOP  an unpopular Democrat nominee  and the Democrats having won the previous two terms. Electing  Trump  twice would be national suicide. If the United States has any chance at regaining its bearings as the greatest constitutional democracy in the world  the populist in chief must be revealed as genuinely unpopular. And it has to happen at the ballot box.,Neutral,0,Negative

407,158,Positive,Business groups have touted the March 5 deadline because they are rushing Congress to legally preserve the DACA program. They want the amnesty preserved to keep the 690 000 DACA people in the labor market  but also to deny  [TGT]  any political leverage that  he  could use to force Congress to accept a broader rewrite of immigration laws that would reduce the inflow of new workers and consumers each year.,Positive,1,Positive

410,159,Positive,The top House tax writer on Wednesday signaled that Congress could still propose changes to a popular retirement savings plan in its tax bill  contradicting an assurance made by  President [TGT] . At a Christian Science Monitor event  Rep. Kevin Brady said Republicans are “exploring a number of ideas” to “create incentives for Americans to save more and save sooner.” The House is “continuing discussions with  the president ” in that area  the House Ways and Means Committee chairman said. “I do have a worry. Not enough Americans are saving ” Brady said at a separate Yahoo Finance conference later in the day. Brady said Republicans have “asked for ideas how Americans (can) save more and save earlier in their lives.”,Neutral,0,Neutral

413,159,Positive, Trump  said 401(k)s are “very important” to  him  because they benefit the middle class but suggested tweaks could be included. “Well maybe it is  maybe we’ll use it as negotiating  but trust me  that’s one of the great things ”  Trump  said. “There are certain elements of deals that you don’t want to negotiate with — and Kevin knows this  and I think Kevin Brady is fantastic — but he knows how important 401(k)s are.”,Neutral,0,Positive
414,159,Positive,That seems a rather convoluted non-answer in light of the line  Trump  drew in the sand with  his  tweet. With President “Let’s Make a Deal ” one never knows whether a promise is a promise or if a promise is just an opening position for negotiation.,Neutral,0,Positive

610,186,Positive,In a move that appealed to his hard-line conservative supporters   Trump  announced in July that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military  reversing Democratic President Barack Obama’s policy of accepting them.  Trump  said on Twitter at the time that the military “cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.”,Positive,1,Positive

617,187,Neutral,Indeed  it’s the president’s reputation for “extemporaneous” policy pronouncements that leads one to wonder whether  [TGT]  meant to “officially” declare a national opioid emergency in August  or whether  he  just blurted out a thought that came to  his  mind.,Negative,-1,Positive

632,190,Positive,"""We're going to have the strongest military we've ever had  by far ""  [TGT]said in an Oval Office appearance Monday. ""In this budget we took care of the military like it's never been taken care of before.""",Positive,1,Positive
633,190,Positive, [TGT] 's budget revived  [TGT]  calls for big cuts to domestic programs that benefit the poor and middle class  such as food stamps  housing subsidies and student loans. Retirement benefits would remain mostly untouched by  [TGT] 's plan  as  [TGT]  has pledged  though Medicare providers would absorb about $500 billion in cuts — a nearly 6 percent reduction. Some beneficiaries in Social Security's disability program would have to re-enter the workforce under proposed changes to eligibility rules.,Neutral,0,Positive
634,190,Positive,While all presidents' budgets are essentially dead on arrival — Congress writes and enacts its own spending legislation —  [TGT] 's plan was dead before it landed. It came just three days after the president signed a bipartisan agreement that set broad parameters for spending over the next two years. That deal  which includes large increases for domestic programs  rendered Monday's  [TGT]  plan for 10-year  $1.7 trillion cuts to domestic agencies such as the departments of Health and Human Services  Agriculture and Housing and Urban Development even more unrealistic.,Positive,1,Positive
635,190,Positive,But after his aides talked up that plan over the weekend   [TGT]suggested that  his  infrastructure proposal wasn't a big deal for  him .,Neutral,0,Positive
636,190,Positive,"""If for any reason   they  don't want to support to it  hey  that's going to be up to  them  ""  he  said of the Republican-controlled Congress. ""What was very important to  me  was the military; what was very important to  me  was the tax cuts.""",Neutral,0,Positive
637,190,Positive," [TGT]also is proposing work requirements for several federal programs  including housing subsidies  food stamps and Medicaid. Such ideas have backing from powerful figures in Congress including Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin  who promises action on a ""workforce development"" agenda this year.",Positive,1,Positive
638,190,Positive,"""The  [TGT]budget proposal makes clear  his  desire to enact massive cuts to health care  anti-poverty programs and investments in economic growth to blunt the deficit-exploding impact of  his  tax cuts for millionaires and corporations "" said Rep. John Yarmuth of Kentucky  the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee.",Positive,1,Positive
639,190,Positive,All told  the new budget sees accumulating deficits of $7.2 trillion over the coming decade;  Trump 's plan last year projected a 10-year shortfall of $3.2 trillion. And that's assuming Trump's rosy economic predictions come true and Congress follows through — in an election year — with politically toxic cuts to social programs  farm subsidies and Medicare providers.,Positive,1,Neutral
640,190,Positive,Last year  Trump 's budget promised such ideas could generate a small budget surplus by 2027; now  his best-case scenario is for a $450 billion deficit that year  more than $300 billion of which can be traced to his December tax cut.,Positive,1,Neutral
641,190,Positive,"Instead   [TGT] 's budget projects that tax revenues will plummet by $3.7 trillion over the 2018-27 decade relative to last year's ""baseline"" estimates.",Positive,1,Neutral
642,190,Positive,The budget also includes $1.6 billion for the second stage of  Trump 's proposed border wall  a 65-mile segment in Texas' Rio Grande Valley.  [TGT] 's request last year for 74 miles of wall in San Diego and the Rio Grande Valley is pending before lawmakers right now.,Neutral,0,Positive
643,190,Positive,Once again  there's no mention of how Mexico would have to pay for it  as  [TGT]  repeatedly promised during the presidential campaign and after  [TGT]  victory.,Neutral,0,Positive
644,190,Positive, [TGT] 's plan promises 3 percent growth for the nation's economy  continuing low inflation and low interest yields on U.S. Treasury bills despite a flood of new borrowing. That likely underestimates the mounting cost of financing the government's $20 trillion-plus debt  many economists say.,Neutral,0,Neutral
645,191,Neutral,The Senate Intelligence Committee has not reached a conclusion whether the  Trump  campaign cooperated with Moscow during the 2016 election  the panel’s leaders said Wednesday  distancing themselves from President Trump’s claim that the issue is a “hoax.”,Negative,-1,Positive

Gillespie is a Washington lobbyist who worked in President George W. Bush’s White House  the kind of establishment mainstay [TGT] bashed on the campaign trail.,Positive,1,Positive
665,195,Positive,That tension has Gillespie looking to thread the thinnest of needles  trying to appeal to voters turned off by  [TGT]  while retaining enough of Trump’s passionate base to secure victory.,Positive,1,Positive

668,195,Positive,But some argue Gillespie is being too cautious. Corey Stewart  who ran against Gillespie in the gubernatorial primary and garnered support from  [TGT] ’s base  said Gillespie erred in not asking the president to campaign for him and in not doing more to harness the energy  Trump  has stirred.,Positive,1,Positive

It used to be global warming ""  [TGT]said. ""That wasn't working too well because it was getting too cold all over the place. The ice caps were going to melt.

But  uh  no I think I eat actually quite well.""",Positive,1,Positive
688,197,Positive,This  in a nutshell  is my analysis of President [TGT]’s tweets:,Positive,1,Neutral
689,197,Positive,They are unflinchingly candid and defiant in the face of political correctness. Occasionally the tweets’ wording is clumsy  and their timing is awkward. But  always   Trump  says what  he  means. Like  President Ronald Reagan  Trump  is a man of a few simple  large ideas. We can extrapolate  his  domestic and foreign policies from  his  body of relevant tweets: lower taxes and fewer regulations  the wall  the emasculation of Obamacare  and the assertion of American military power. However  unlike Reagan  who was witty and self-effacing   Trump  commands the language with cupped hands.  He  wields superlative adjectives the way a shot-putter heaves an iron ball  with mindless vigor rather than precision.,Negative,-1,Positive
690,197,Positive,Any tweet  Trump  sends out that doesn’t have to do with less intrusive government  or illegal immigration  or international challenges to American interests  we may frankly regard as Twitter trash. These extraneous tweets serve only to feed the media’s frenzy. The same news media which breezily allowed former President Barack Obama’s scandals and blunders to escape their notice now turn their focus on Trump’s every misstep  like searchlights on a wart.,Positive,1,Neutral
691,197,Positive,Obama’s political locution was unnervingly suave. To my ears  however  Obama sounded like a passive-aggressive firebrand. Whenever he opened his mouth  I heard: “You suck.” For eight years  I endured his lectures and insinuated insults. Forgive me for relishing the left’s hysteria over  Trump ’s slangy pronouncements.,Negative,-1,Neutral
692,197,Positive,Hillary Clinton lost because she lacked Obama’s smooth rhetorical obfuscation. Her speechifying exuded the boredom and tension of snarled traffic. Compared to her  at the debates   Trump  was positively Whitman-esque.,Neutral,0,Neutral
693,197,Positive,I don’t even use a smartphone. I can gauge the effect of  Trump ’s tweets only from the pained uproar of the media. How tweet it is — says  Trump  to them — to be loathed by you!,Positive,1,Positive
694,198,Positive,Our research examined the Twitter followers of both  [TGT]and Hillary Clinton  and the sources of information and brands that their supporters follow: 648 brands followed by more than 19 million  [TGT]  and Clinton supporters collectively. By analyzing the President’s and former Secretary of State’s followers and those they follow  we were able to glean insight into the brand preferences of each politician’s followers  such as what news  beer and car brands they consume or are likely to choose.,Positive,1,Neutral
695,198,Positive,The “Brand Universes” of  [TGT]and Hillary Clinton supports the widely-held beliefs about the profiles and demographics of the two candidates’ supporters. For example  President  Trump ’s Twitter followers had strong affinity with the alcoholic brands Budweiser  Coors  Jim Beam  Maker’s Mark; sports brands and media such as Ping  the Golf Chanel and Fox Sports; financial and media brands such as SmartyPig  Mint  MarketWatch  Fox Business  and the Drudge Report. Secretary Clinton’s followers  on the other hand  showed strong attraction for brands that are often associated with women and millennials such as Gap  Maybelline  Cover Girl  and J. Crew and media channels that speak to liberal audiences such as The Atlantic  Vox  Aljazeera America and Ebony Magazine.,Negative,-1,Positive
696,198,Positive,By combining these brand universes with consumer data from Young & Rubicam’s BrandAsset Valuator (BAV) model  we are able to unearth the personality characteristics of each politician’s followers by the brands they follow. The brands monitored by  Donald Trump’s  followers were characterized as: straightforward; down to earth; rugged; unstylish; and non-trendy. The brands tracked by Hillary Clinton’s followers were described as: intelligent; socially responsible; glamorous; not fun; and not energetic. Interestingly  these characteristics were commonly associated with the two politicians themselves.,Positive,1,Positive
697,198,Positive,The takeaway is stark: by using this data  if you tell us who you follow on social media  we can assess your political affiliation and who you are likely to vote for in the future. Indeed   President Trump’s  electoral success has been partially attributed to  his  ability to harness the power of Twitter and tailor  his  rhetoric to reflect the values of  his  followers.,Positive,1,Positive
698,198,Positive,The same social media source that allows  [TGT]to instantly reach  [TGT]  followers can be used to help us better understand how brand associations can unduly reinforce political bias and fuel the polarization of our nation.,Positive,1,Positive

707,199,Positive,"Trump has had a contentious relationship with the press since his campaign  regularly lashing out at certain media outlets — even individual journalists — and accusing many publications and news stations of being ""fake news.""

739,202,Positive,WASHINGTON (AP) —  [TGT]declared late Wednesday  [TGT] ’s “looking forward” to being questioned — under oath — in the special counsel’s probe of Russian election interference and possible  [TGT]  obstruction in the firing of the FBI director.,Positive,1,Neutral
740,202,Positive, [TGT]said  [TGT]  would be willing to answer questions under oath in the interview  which special counsel Robert Mueller has been seeking but which White house officials had not previously said [TGT] would grant.,Positive,1,Positive
741,202,Positive,“I’m looking forward to it  actually ”  [TGT]said when asked by reporters at the White House. Ad for timing   [TGT]  said  “I guess they’re talking about two or three weeks  but I’d love to do it.”,Positive,1,Positive
742,202,Positive, [TGT]  said  as  he  has repeatedly  that “there’s no collusion whatsoever” with the Russians  and  he  added  “There’s no obstruction whatsoever.”,Positive,1,Positive
743,202,Positive,The full scope of Mueller’s investigation  which involves hundreds of thousands of documents and dozens of witness interviews  is unknown. And there have been no signs that agents aren’t continuing to work on ties between [TGT] ’s campaign and a Russian effort to tip the 2016 election.,Positive,1,Positive
744,202,Positive,But now that Mueller’s team has all but concluded its interviews with current and former  [TGT]  officials  and expressed interest in speaking with the president himself  the focus seems to be on the post-inauguration White House. That includes the firing of FBI Director James Comey and discussions preceding the ouster of White House National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.,Positive,1,Positive
745,202,Positive,The timing and circumstances of a  [TGT]  interview are still being ironed out. But soon it will probably be the president himself who will have to explain to Mueller how his actions don’t add up to obstruction of justice. And that conversation will be dominated by questions tied whether he took steps to thwart an FBI investigation.,Positive,1,Positive
746,202,Positive,A focus on potential obstruction has been evident almost since Mueller’s appointment as special counsel. And recent interviews with administration officials  including Attorney General Jeff Sessions  have shown that  [TGT]is dealing with prosecutors who already have amassed a wealth of knowledge about the events  [TGT] ’ll be questioned about.,Neutral,0,Positive
747,202,Positive,Prosecutors have interviewed numerous White House aides including  [TGT] ’s closest confidants such as Counsel Don McGahn  former chief of staff Reince Priebus and the president’s son-in-law  Jared Kushner.,Positive,1,Neutral
748,202,Positive,Sessions  the target of the president’s ire since he stepped aside last March from the Russia investigation  would have been able to offer close-up insight into the president’s thinking ahead of the termination. He also could have been able to speak to the president’s relationship with Comey  which Comey documented in a series of memos about conversations with  [TGT]  that bothered him.,Positive,1,Positive
749,202,Positive,In one memo  Comey described a January 2017 meeting over dinner at which he said the president asked him to pledge his loyalty. Separately  a person familiar with the conversation said this week that  Trump  in a meeting last year with Deputy Director Andrew McCabe brought up McCabe’s wife’s political background following the revelation that she had accepted campaign contributions during a state Senate run from the political action committee of then-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe  a close Clinton ally.,Positive,1,Positive
750,202,Positive,The Washington Post reported Tuesday night that  [TGT]  had also asked McCabe whom he voted for in the presidential race. McCabe replied that he did not vote.  Trump  said Wednesday  he  did not recall asking that question.,Positive,1,Positive
751,202,Positive,Another of Comey’s memos centered on a February conversation at the White House in which  he  said  Trump  told  him   he  believed Flynn  the fired national security adviser  was a “good guy” and encouraged Comey to drop an investigation into him. The FBI had interviewed Flynn weeks earlier about whether  he  had discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador during the transition period between the election and the inauguration. Flynn pleaded guilty in December to lying to the FBI during that interview.,Neutral,0,Neutral
752,202,Positive, Mueller  has been investigating the events leading up to Flynn’s dismissal from the White House  including how officials responded to information from former acting Attorney General Sally Yates that Flynn had misled them by saying that  he  had not discussed sanctions. Despite that warning  and despite an FBI interview days after Trump’s inauguration  Flynn was not forced to resign until Feb. 13 — the night of media reports about Yates’ conversation with McGahn.,Positive,1,Neutral

754,203,Positive,"""That's what I am dealing with ""  he  wrote.",Positive,1,Neutral
755,203,Positive,The first is that there are now effectively two Republican parties -- one dominated by  Trump  and  his  uber-loyal followers  for whom  his  feud with Corker represents exactly the kind of disruption they hoped to see  him  unleash. The other GOP  meanwhile  is made up of establishment  orthodox conservatives like the Tennessee senator and his Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  who want to use their power to legislate and fret about  Trump 's global leadership.,Neutral,0,Positive
756,203,Positive,The second rule of last year's Republican primary circus is one that Corker is now daring to confound -- namely that no one who gets down in the muck with a brutal political street-fighter like  Trump  comes out clean or unscathed.  Trump 's showdown with Corker  which went nuclear over the weekend  will go a long way to deciding the state of the GOP as it musters for midterm elections next year -- at which its monopoly in Washington will be on the line.,Positive,1,Positive
757,203,Positive,It could also show whether  Trump 's go-to tactic of waging war on the Republican Party establishment  that has proven so profitable in the past  is a viable strategy going forward or whether it is ultimately self-defeating.  Trump  briefly toed the party line in backing Alabama Sen. Luther Strange in  his  losing primary race against Roy Moore last month -- but even before voters went to the polls  he admitted he might have done the wrong thing.,Positive,1,Positive
758,203,Positive,"""But  [TGT]  challenged the Republican establishment -- there are a lot of Republicans like  me  that quite frankly were sick of the same old  same old ...  he  has continued to fight the system "" Bauer added.",Positive,1,Positive
759,203,Positive,There have been signs that if  Trump  fails to secure results on Capitol Hill   he  could effectively become the first sitting Republican president to run against a do-nothing Congress of  his  own party in the midterms  perhaps by backing insurgent GOPers in primary races against establishment lawmakers.,Positive,1,Positive
760,203,Positive,"And from the party's grassroots  Corker's intervention may seem less consequential than it did in Washington  which was transfixed by the spat that culminated when  the senator  warned  Trump 's volatile temperament could put the US on the path to ""World War III.""",Positive,1,Positive
761,203,Positive,Some Washington pundits and media commentators praised Corker for having the courage to finally stand up to  Trump   for voicing what many GOP figures say privately and for no longer appeasing what they see as the President's dangerous approach to crises like the standoff with North Korea.,Neutral,0,Positive

Trump 's unpredictable ways and tendency to turn upon Republicans has contributed to  his  struggle to secure a major legislative win.  His  efforts to help repeal Obamacare  for instance  often seemed ill-informed or counterproductive.,Positive,1,Neutral
765,203,Positive,And when Republican Sen.

One intelligence official argued: “It’s probably a tie as to who is the bigger traitor” – Bergdahl or [TGT]. With a political ecology in which standards have been debased  many have attempted to rationalize President Obama’s decision.

947,242,Neutral,But  [TGT] ’s rule regarding denials regarding sexual abuse cease to apply if  he  can attack  his  political opponents.

949,242,Neutral,But suffice it to say that  [TGT] standard puts decent conservatives at severe moral risk. The question here isn’t whether  [TGT]  stands for “innocent until proven guilty.”  [TGT]  doesn’t.

997,248,Positive,Former Justice spokesman Matt Miller observes that “even beyond the criminal question  which we spend a lot of time on for good reason. . . .the idea of the White House trying to intervene in matters involving an investigation into [TGT] is beyond unacceptable.” The White House spokeswoman’s denial that  [TGT]had any role to play in McCabe’s departure is laughable  and once again raises the question as to why the White House continues to mislead and coverup its actions if it believes [TGT] is behaving properly.,Neutral,0,Positive
998,248,Positive,What is also apparent is that far from a moderating influence  Kelly is a foot soldier in  Trump’s  effort to intimidate the FBI. “After  [TGT] ’s strong reaction on Air Force One over the Boyd letter  White House officials  including Kelly  sprang into action again  lashing Justice Department officials Thursday over the decision to send the letter ” Bloomberg reports.,Positive,1,Positive

Baker  then the federal witness tampering statute (18 USC Section 1512) might come into play. That statute makes it illegal to use intimidation  threaten  or corruptly persuade another person  or attempts to do so with intent  among other things  to induce someone to change or withhold testimony or to “hinder  delay  or prevent the communication to a law enforcement officer or judge of the United States of information relating to the commission or possible commission of a Federal offense.”,Positive,1,Negative

1059,256,Positive,The new restrictions could significantly reduce the number of foreign-born workers in the U.S. labor force  but demographic experts say there is little chance they will alter the country’s broader racial and ethnic transformation  which Trump’s critics say is his goal.

1077,258,Positive,Neal Katyal wrote the special counsel regulations when he worked under President Clinton. Now he lays out the legal issues that could arise if  [TGT]tries to interfere with the Mueller investigation.,Positive,1,Neutral
1078,258,Positive,This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross.  [TGT]has called Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation a witch hunt. Last week   [TGT]told New York Times reporter Michael Schmidt  I have the absolute right to do what I want to do with the Justice Department  implying that he can end the investigation whenever he wants. So what power does he have to stop or stymie the investigation into Russian interference in the election and any links and or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the [TGT] campaign and how consequential is Paul Manafort's lawsuit against special counsel Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein?,Positive,1,Positive
1079,258,Positive,Here to discuss those and other related questions is Neal Katyal who  in 1999  drafted the special counsel regulations under which Mueller was appointed. Katyal served as acting solicitor general under President Obama. He's the lead lawyer for the state of Hawaii's challenge of [TGT]'s travel ban. He's argued many cases before the Supreme Court. In fact  that's where he'll be next week. He's a professor of law at Georgetown University and a partner in the law firm Hogan Lovells.,Positive,1,Positive
1080,258,Positive,GROSS: So I'm going to ask you the question I'm sure you're most often asked which is  does  [TGT]have the power to fire special counsel Robert Mueller?,Positive,1,Neutral
1081,258,Positive,KATYAL: I think the answer to that is yes. And I think  [TGT]  can do it in  you know  either directly or indirectly. Some people think it can only be indirect. But I think  either way  there's a way in which it can get done. So these regulations are Justice Department regulations. They can be removed by another attorney general or an acting attorney general potentially. So [TGT] could theoretically order Sessions to remove these regulations as a whole.,Positive,1,Neutral
1082,258,Positive,And  you know  I would love to talk about who this special counsel is  Robert Mueller and his credentials  in a moment. But let's just say you had one that - an attorney general appointed a bozo. The bozo wouldn't be able to  you know  put someone in jail. The bozo first has to work with a staff and is supervised by the acting attorney general of the United States. Now  who's the acting attorney general of the United States - the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. And who put Rod Rosenstein in power? It wasn't Barack Obama. It was  [TGT] . This is - Rosenstein is  [TGT] 's guy. He's the guy he put there.,Positive,1,Neutral
1083,258,Positive,GROSS: So if  [TGT]asked the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to fire the special counsel Robert Mueller and Rosenstein refused  then  he  could - then  [TGT]  could fire Rosenstein  and his replacement would be asked to fire Robert Mueller and that could go on for a while. But the other possibility - or at least another possibility that  [TGT]could use would be to fire Rod Rosenstein and to replace him with somebody who would have a very favorable eye toward [TGT] . So is that a scenario that you could see playing out and working under the guidelines for the special counsel as you wrote them?,Positive,1,Neutral
1084,258,Positive,KATYAL: So it is possible for [TGT] to try to fire Rosenstein. Rosenstein is a presidential appointee. As I say  he's  Trump 's guy  and he can be removed by [TGT] . He'd have to be replaced in some way in order for the deputy attorney general to have any function. So you'd have to put someone else in place. Normally  that requires Senate confirmation to put that person in place.,Positive,1,Negative
1085,258,Positive,And I would suspect that there would be incredible blood on the floor of the U.S. Senate - I mean  just the most divisive debate possible if someone was being confirmed to replace Rod Rosenstein who  by all accounts  has done a good job supervising the Mueller investigation. So I think  yes  there's the theoretical power that  Trump  has  but it'll be constrained by  in practice  the problem that he couldn't confirm a new person to that post.,Positive,1,Neutral
1086,258,Positive,GROSS: This is FRESH AIR My guest is Neal Katyal. He drafted the regulations defining the powers of the special counsel and the limitations of those powers. So we're talking about the Robert Mueller investigation and what powers  President Trump  has to end or stymie that investigation. Neal Katyal served as the deputy solicitor general under President Obama. He's a lawyer in private practice now. But he still argues many cases before the Supreme Court.,Positive,1,Positive
1087,258,Positive,So something that you point out  President Trump  could do is  he  could pardon everyone who's being investigated. Are you saying  he  could even pardon them before they're convicted of anything?,Positive,1,Positive
1088,258,Positive,GROSS: So I don't know if this is outside of your view or not  but the House and the Senate have intelligence committees that are also investigating any connections between the  Trump  campaign and Russia and Russian interference in the American election. Are there things that they can do that would make it difficult for Mueller to pursue his investigation?,Positive,1,Positive
1089,258,Positive,GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross  back with Neal Katyal. In 1999  he drafted the regulations defining the powers of the special counsel under which Robert Mueller was appointed. Katyal was acting solicitor general in the Obama administration and has argued 35 cases before the Supreme Court.

1090,258,Positive,GROSS: Right. The two people who wrote that op-ed you're talking about  Glenn Simpson and Peter Fritsch of Fusion GPS  they're calling for the release of 21 hours of testimony that they gave.

They say the transcripts show that they suggested to the committee that the investigators look into the bank records of Deutsche Bank and others that were funding  [TGT] 's businesses. They write  (reading) but Congress appeared uninterested in that. Reportedly ours - the Fusion GPS - are the only bank records the House intelligence committee has subpoenaed.,Positive,1,Neutral

He has not uttered a single word in public  works from an undisclosed location in Southwest Washington and demonstrated the same discipline and disdain for theatrics that defined his 12-year tenure as FBI director.

1269,282,Neutral,The predictably rapid leak of details about  [TGT] ’s reaction from inside the White House only highlighted the contrast with Mueller  whose legal team has a lock on the progress of the probe.

1270,282,Neutral,Mueller’s refusal to engage publicly sets him apart from other legal and political adversaries that  [TGT]has encountered since his entry into politics.

1325,289,Positive,HORSLEY: [TGT]'s strategy identifies three main categories of adversaries - transnational gangs of terrorists and criminals  rogue states like North Korea and what the White House calls revisionist powers such as China and Russia. That doesn't rule out cooperation with those countries.

Foreign policy analyst Dan Drezner of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy says there's not much sign of that in the last year.,Positive,1,Positive
1328,289,Positive,HORSLEY: Drezner says by bucking international agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris climate accord   [TGT]has prompted other countries to look past the U.S. In some cases  competitors like China have stepped in to fill the void. On his trip to Asia last month   [TGT]celebrated his red carpet welcome as a sign of respect for America  but Drezner suspects it's really a way of playing to the president's ego.,Positive,1,Positive

1365,296,Neutral,[TGT]have locked down  [TGT]  vision of the nuclear future.  It  is  by and large  a rehash of old thinking from previous administrations  but  its  one key departure is a doozy: It declares a newfound readiness to use U.S. nuclear weapons first and early in a confrontation with Russia and possibly others.,Neutral,0,Neutral
1366,296,Neutral,[No one can stop [TGT] from using nuclear weapons. That’s by design.],Negative,-1,Positive
1367,296,Neutral,Russia developed this doctrine over the past five years partially to exploit growing infrastructure vulnerabilities stemming from growing Western dependencies on these networks  and partially to reduce Russia’s own strategic reliance on first use of nuclear arms. By focusing on cyberwar and conventional forces  Russia seeks to depend less on its 20-year-old doctrine of “escalate to de-escalate ” which calls for the early first use of small-yield Russian tactical nuclear weapons to counter Western conventional supremacy. (This Russian option is also cited by the [TGT] review as a reason for acquiring and using countervailing low-yield U.S. nuclear weapons.),Neutral,0,Positive
1368,296,Neutral,The West’s Achilles’ heel of infrastructure vulnerability may tempt other adversaries besides Russia to take aim at this weakness in wartime. Indeed  the [TGT] administration’s document leaves the door ajar for possible U.S. nuclear first strikes against non-nuclear countries if they wreck our critical civilian infrastructure.,Positive,1,Positive
1369,296,Neutral,The burden of nuclear first use should remain on Russia and not be allowed to shift onto NATO. No American president wants to feel pressure to authorize the early first use of nuclear weapons. The correct approach is for the West to exploit its own cyber and conventional prowess to counter Russia on its own terms  exploiting Western superiority in these areas and leaving the burden of nuclear first use on Russia’s shoulders.

1404,302,Positive,[TGT]'s infrastructure plan  released Monday   is more of a defiance of fiscal logic than  [TGT]  is a rational outline. One obvious shortcoming is that  [TGT]doesn't offer states and cities federal money as much as invite them to spend their own  which  of course  they could already do.,Negative,-1,Neutral
1405,302,Positive,Perhaps the biggest drawback  though  is that  [TGT]pits urban and rural areas against each other when [TGT] comes to the small amount of money [TGT] does offer. All of America needs investment  but [TGT]'s blatant prejudice against cities would only widen the nation's political and cultural animosities.,Neutral,0,Neutral
1406,302,Positive, [TGT]has disappointed in many ways  but this failure is an acute letdown. In the mid-1980s   [TGT]scored one of  his  early p.r. coups with a modest New York City infrastructure triumph  finishing a Central Park skating rink after the city had failed. In 2016   he  ran heavily on the issue – and implied that  he 'd apply  his  supposed building expertise to  his  hometown. “We have the old Long Island Rail Road ”  he  said at one fundraiser  “like we're a third-world country. They have trains that go 250 mph  we have old stuff ”  he  continued  referring to China. “That's not going to happen anymore with  me .”,Neutral,0,Neutral
1407,302,Positive,Yet [TGT]announced does nothing to advance real high-speed rail in dense corridors where [TGT] could work well. London is about to launch a train service to Amsterdam  covering 222 miles in three hours. Here  it still takes nearly four hours to get from New York to Boston  about the same distance.,Neutral,0,Positive
1408,302,Positive,Real high-speed rail is a multi-billion-dollar  long-term investment. Yet  [TGT] offers just $200 billion over a decade to all infrastructure. That's just 20 percent more than what the nation is already spending under an Obama-era law  and it is supposed to cover roads  highways  passenger rail  ports  airports  drinking water  flood control  and wastewater  and “transformative” projects  across 50 states as well as U.S. territories.,Neutral,0,Positive
1409,302,Positive,Never mind world-class rail  then.  Trump 's infrastructure proposal makes it more difficult to build an element needed just to keep existing rail service: a new tunnel under the Hudson River between Manhattan and New Jersey  so that the century-old one  which serves both Amtrak and Jersey commuters  can be closed and rehabbed. Whereas  the Obama administration  had offered to split the $14 billion or so cost with New York and New Jersey   [TGT]dismisses  [TGT]  as a “local” project.,Neutral,0,Positive
1410,302,Positive,And the infrastructure proposal says exactly how much  [TGT]cares about such “local” projects. Of the $100 billion the proposal proffers to traditional infrastructure   it  caps the contribution to any one state at $10 billion. That means a state like New York might receive $5 billion for its portion the Hudson tunnel. But after that  it would have only $5 billion for other projects – when the state-run Metropolitan Transportation Authority alone was expecting $7.6 billion from federal sources for projects ranging from Phase 2 of the Second Avenue Subway to modernizing its signal systems.,Negative,-1,Positive
1411,302,Positive,Under the new “rural infrastructure program ” the definition of infrastructure is broader than the overall definition. It includes high-speed internet and government-owned electrical infrastructure  whereas elsewhere in the plan  [TGT] wants to sell such infrastructure to the private sector.,Neutral,0,Positive
1412,302,Positive, The [TGT] infrastructure plan  is unfair  and economically unwise  beyond money.  The proposal  would also cede far more control to state politicians for rural projects than for urban or suburban ones.  The rural program  would provide 80 percent of  its  $50 billion  or $40 billion  to governors  who would “have discretion to choose individual investments to respond to the unique rural needs of their states ”  the proposal  says.,Neutral,0,Neutral
1413,302,Positive,That's a stark contrast with the larger $100 billion program for everyone else. For  the bigger program   the federal government  not governors  will decide which projects to fund under a complex  likely manipulable formula involving predictions about matters such as “the incorporation of new and evolving technologies” – sometimes a good thing and sometimes not in the real world – and “ economic and social returns on investment.” Yet officials in urban areas often govern more people than entire states.

1425,304,Positive,In 2016  Mother Jones first reported that Democratic sources funded research efforts for [TGT]. But on Tuesday  The Post went a step further  reporting that it was the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee. A lawyer working on behalf of the campaign and the committee retained a Washington firm named Fusion GPS to do the research  which originally began during the Republican presidential primaries. The firm’s efforts were first supported by a Republican donor who had tasked the firm to look into Trump’s background. That individual’s identity remains unknown.,Positive,1,Neutral

1451,308,Neutral,On Wednesday   [TGT]said  [TGT]  was looking forward to sitting down with Special Counsel Robert Mueller  who is heading up the DOJ’s probe into whether  [TGT]  campaign colluded with the Russians during the 2016 election. Yet  does Mueller know that  [TGT]reportedly wanted  him  gone last June? The New York Times is reporting that  [TGT]  wanted to remove Mueller last June  but backed off when the White House counsel threatened resignation. Controversy erupted from the outset of this probe  as Mueller seemed to have assembled a team of die-hard Democrats  though the publication added that since the White House hired Ty Cobb  the lawyer that manages the relationship between 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. and the Mueller probe  the criticism towards the investigation has been reduced significantly. Another idea that was reportedly tossed around was firing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and putting Rachel Brand  the third highest-ranking DOJ official  in his place to oversee the Mueller.,Neutral,0,Positive
1452,308,Neutral,Mr. McGahn disagreed with the president’s case and told senior White House officials that firing Mr. Mueller would have a catastrophic effect on  Mr. Trump’s  presidency. Mr. McGahn also told White House officials that  [TGT]would not follow through on the dismissal on  [TGT]  own.  The president  then backed off.,Negative,-1,Neutral
1453,308,Neutral,Another option that  [TGT]considered in discussions with  [TGT]  advisers was dismissing the deputy attorney general  Rod J. Rosenstein  and elevating the department’s No. 3  official  Rachel Brand  to oversee Mr. Mueller . Mr. Rosenstein has overseen the investigation since March  when Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself.,Negative,-1,Neutral
1454,308,Neutral, [TGT]has significantly ratcheted back  [TGT]  criticisms of Mr. Mueller since he hired Mr. Cobb in July.  A veteran of several high-profile Washington controversies  Mr. Cobb  has known Mr. Mueller for decades  dating to their early careers in the Justice Department.,Positive,1,Neutral
1455,308,Neutral, He  advised  [TGT]that  he  had nothing to gain from combat with Mr. Mueller  a highly respected former prosecutor and F.B.I. director who has subpoena power as special counsel. Since Mr. Cobb’s arrival  the White House has operated on the premise that the quickest way to clear the cloud of suspicion was to cooperate with Mr. Mueller  not to fight him.,Neutral,0,Neutral
1456,309,Positive,[TGT] asked two of the nation’s top intelligence officials in March to help  [TGT]  push back against an FBI investigation into possible coordination between  [TGT]  campaign and the Russian government  according to current and former officials.,Neutral,0,Positive
1457,309,Positive, [TGT]made separate appeals to the director of national intelligence  Daniel Coats  and to Adm. Michael S. Rogers  the director of the National Security Agency  urging them to publicly deny the existence of any evidence of collusion during the 2016 election.,Positive,1,Positive
1458,309,Positive, [TGT]sought the assistance of Coats and Rogers after FBI Director James B. Comey told the House Intelligence Committee on March 20 that the FBI was investigating “the nature of any links between individuals associated with the  [TGT]  campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia’s efforts.”,Neutral,0,Positive
1459,309,Positive, Trump’s  conversation with Rogers was documented contemporaneously in an internal memo written by a senior NSA official  according to the officials. It is unclear if a similar memo was prepared by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to document  Trump ’s conversation with Coats. Officials said such memos could be made available to both the special counsel now overseeing the Russia investigation and congressional investigators  who might explore whether  [TGT]sought to impede the FBI’s work.,Positive,1,Positive
1460,309,Positive,White House officials say Comey’s testimony about the scope of the FBI investigation upset  Trump   who has dismissed the FBI and congressional investigations as a “witch hunt.” The president has repeatedly said there was no collusion.,Neutral,0,Positive
1461,309,Positive,Current and former senior intelligence officials viewed  Trump’s  requests as an attempt by the president to tarnish the credibility of the agency leading the Russia investigation.,Neutral,0,Positive
1462,309,Positive,A senior intelligence official said  Trump’s  goal was to “muddy the waters” about the scope of the FBI probe at a time when Democrats were ramping up their calls for the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel  a step announced last week.,Positive,1,Positive
1463,309,Positive,In addition to the requests to Coats and Rogers  senior White House officials sounded out top intelligence officials about the possibility of intervening directly with Comey to encourage the FBI to drop its probe of Michael Flynn  Trump’s former national security adviser  according to people familiar with the matter. The officials said the White House appeared uncertain about its power to influence the FBI.,Neutral,0,Positive
1464,309,Positive,The new revelations add to a growing body of evidence that  [TGT]sought to co-opt and then undermine Comey before he fired him May 9. According to notes kept by  [TGT]first asked for  [TGT]  loyalty at a dinner in January and then  at a meeting the next month  asked  [TGT]  to drop the probe into Flynn.  [TGT]  disputes those accounts.,Positive,1,Negative
1465,309,Positive,Current and former officials said that  [TGT]  either lacks an understanding of the FBI’s role as an independent law enforcement agency or does not care about maintaining such boundaries.,Positive,1,Positive
1466,309,Positive, Trump’s  effort to use the director of national intelligence and the NSA director to dispute Comey’s statement and to say there was no evidence of collusion echoes President Richard Nixon’s “unsuccessful efforts to use the CIA to shut down the FBI’s investigation of the Watergate break-in on national security grounds ” said Jeffrey H. Smith  a former general counsel at the CIA. [TGT] actions “an appalling abuse of power.”,Neutral,0,Positive
1467,309,Positive, [TGT]made  [TGT]  appeal to Coats days after Comey’s testimony  according to officials.,Positive,1,Positive
1468,309,Positive,That same week   [TGT]telephoned Rogers to make a similar appeal.,Neutral,0,Positive
1469,309,Positive,In  his  call with  Rogers  [TGT]  urged the NSA director to speak out publicly if there was no evidence of collusion  according to officials briefed on the exchange.,Positive,1,Positive
1470,309,Positive,While relations between  [TGT]and Comey were strained by the Russia probe  ties between the president and the other intelligence chiefs  including Rogers  Coats and CIA Director Mike Pompeo  appear to be less contentious  according to officials.,Neutral,0,Positive

1473,310,Neutral,The official  Chuck Rosenberg  who twice served as chief of staff to the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey and remains a close confidant  had grown disillusioned with [TGT] .  The president  fired Mr. Comey in May  and then in July told law enforcement officers “please don’t be too nice” when handling crime suspects.,Neutral,0,Neutral
1474,310,Neutral,Mr. Rosenberg forcefully rejected  Mr. Trump’s  comment  sending an email to all D.E.A. employees at the time to tell them that they should not mistreat suspects.,Neutral,0,Neutral
1475,310,Neutral, [TGT]has injected the White House into law enforcement matters in ways that have made many career officials uncomfortable.  The president  spoke disparagingly about ongoing criminal investigations into  his  own associates  encouraged the Justice Department to investigate political rivals including Hillary Clinton and said  he  would never have nominated Jeff Sessions to be attorney general if  he  had known Mr. Sessions would recuse  himself  from an investigation into  his  associates.,Neutral,0,Positive

1478,311,Neutral,On Oct. 13   [TGT]  announced that  [TGT]  would not once again certify Iran’s compliance with the JCPOA.  [TGT]  decision “gives Congress the option to introduce legislation reimposing U.S. sanctions waived or suspended under the JCPOA on an expedited schedule ” the Arms Control Association says.,Positive,1,Neutral
1479,311,Neutral, [TGT]said Iran committed “multiple violations” of the JCPOA  which was negotiated by the U.S.  China  France  Germany  Russia and the United Kingdom  as well as representatives of the European Union and Iran.,Neutral,0,Positive
1480,311,Neutral,[TGT]Oct. 13: Iranian regime has committed multiple violations of the agreement. For example  on two separate occasions  they have exceeded the limit of 130 metric tons of heavy water. Until recently  the Iranian regime has also failed to meet our expectations in its operation of advanced centrifuges. The Iranian regime has also intimidated international inspectors into not using the full inspection authorities that the agreement calls for. Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow inspectors onto military sites  even though the international community suspects some of those sites were part of Iran’s clandestine nuclear weapons program.,Neutral,0,Positive
1481,311,Neutral,Let’s take a look at each of the three issues [TGT] raised  beginning with the limits on heavy water.,Neutral,0,Positive
1482,311,Neutral,On two occasions  Iran has slightly exceeded the limits. The first time was in February 2016  a month after the agreement was implemented  and again in November. So  [TGT]is right  although  [TGT]  was aware of these violations when  [TGT]  agreed twice before to certify Iran’s compliance.,Positive,1,Negative
1483,311,Neutral,As for Trump’s concern about advanced centrifuges  David Albright  an IAEA weapons inspector in Iraq during the 1990s and founder of the Institute for Science and International Security  said that issue has been resolved.,Positive,1,Positive
1484,311,Neutral,Trump’s reference to inspections at military sites refers to Section T of the JCPOA that covers the development of dual-use equipment that has civilian and military applications  according to Albright  an adviser to the [TGT] administration. Albright said the IAEA needs access to military sites in order to verify Iran’s compliance with Section T of the agreement.,Neutral,0,Positive
1485,311,Neutral,“This is the most egregious of Trump’s claims ” Davenport  of the Arms Control Association  told us. “The IAEA clearly stated that Iran has granted inspectors all of the access the agency has requested. If Iran had blocked access  the P5+1  including the United States  would not have been able to say that Iran is complying with the accord.”,Neutral,0,Positive
1486,311,Neutral,In a statement issued in response to Trump’s speech  IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano said that “the IAEA has had access to all locations it needed to visit.”,Neutral,0,Positive
1487,311,Neutral,We take no position on [TGT] desire to renegotiate aspects of the Iran deal that [TGT] does not like. The issue  though  is whether Iran has complied with the existing agreement  and even those within [TGT] own administration have said that Iran is in compliance.,Neutral,0,Positive
1488,311,Neutral,Correction  Oct. 14: We originally wrote that  [TGT]was referring to the Parchin military site when  [TGT]  criticized Iran for not allowing IAEA inspections of military sites. Albright  an adviser to the president  told us that  [TGT]was referring to inspections at all military sites  not just Parchin  to ensure that Iran is in compliance with Section T of the JCPOA. That section covers the development of dual-use equipment that can be used for civilian and military purposes. The revised version of this story reflects that change.,Neutral,0,Positive
1489,312,Positive,“People were so torched by Cruz’s failure to endorse Trump that talk of primarying him ignited almost the moment he walked off the stage ” Ingraham wrote in her new book  Billionaire at the Barricades: [TGT]. “In fact  a tanned  good-old-boy type in [TGT] late 40s approached me and asked me if I’d consider moving to Texas to run against him.”,Neutral,0,Positive

1498,314,Positive,MARTIN: All right. So Congress hasn't been talking about the budget or immigration. They have been talking about memos - one in particular. Last week ended with the release of this partisan memo written by House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes.  [TGT]says that the memo vindicates  [TGT]  on the Russia investigation.  [TGT]  - clearly  [TGT] believes that this is going to have some kind of effect.,Positive,1,Positive
1499,314,Positive,DETROW: Yeah. It was interesting. You had a lot of Republicans  House Speaker Paul Ryan and others  saying this memo was not about taking down the Mueller investigation. It was not about discrediting the FBI. Then  [TGT]over the weekend comes out and says that it's exactly that - that this proves the Russia investigation is a hoax. So many Republicans actually pushed back on that over the weekend after  [TGT]said that  among them South Carolina Congressman Trey Gowdy speaking to CBS.,Positive,1,Neutral
1500,314,Positive,TREY GOWDY: The dossier has nothing to do with a meeting at Trump Tower. The dossier has nothing to do with an email sent by Cambridge Analytica. The dossier really has nothing to do with George Papadopoulos' meeting in Great Britain. It also doesn't have anything to do with obstruction of justice. So there's going to be a Russia probe even without a dossier.,Positive,1,Neutral
1501,314,Positive,DETROW: Exactly. The argument was that the FBI took this document with partisan beginnings and used it to get wiretaps approved. And Gowdy was laying out several other factors that the FBI was allegedly looking at. But  you know  this memo certainly has muddied the water and led to a lot of Republicans bashing the FBI  bashing the Justice Department. And [TGT] seems confident that even if this doesn't undermine the investigation itself  it may undermine public confidence in whatever the investigation concludes.,Positive,1,Neutral
1502,314,Positive,DETROW: Unclear. The House Intelligence Committee meets this afternoon and may vote on that. Even if they approve it   [TGT]would have to give the final OK.

1528,317,Positive,Barr  who was the 2012 presidential nominee of the California-based left-wing Peace and Freedom Party  has previously defended  [TGT]from relentless media attacks  which  [TGT]  claimed were really “disguised” attacks on American voters.,Positive,1,Neutral
1529,317,Positive,Barr was also a prominent critic of Hillary Clinton  saying in the run-up to last year’s election that America would be “so lucky” if [TGT] won “because then [TGT] wouldn’t be Hillary.”,Neutral,0,Positive
1530,318,Positive,Jimmy Carter  the liberal 93-year-old former president  surprisingly sided with [TGT]when  he  told The New York Times that the media have been too hostile on the current commander-in-chief.,Neutral,0,Positive
1531,318,Positive,“I think the media have been harder on [TGT]than any other president certainly that I’ve known about ” Carter told The New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd.  The 39th president  served one term from 1977 to 1981.,Positive,1,Positive
1532,318,Positive,Carter added that he thought the media “feel free to claim that  [TGT]is mentally deranged and everything else without hesitation.”,Positive,1,Neutral
1533,318,Positive, The former president  also pushed back on accusations of Russian collusion in the 2016 presidential election  saying: “I don’t think there’s any evidence that what the Russians did changed enough votes  or any votes.”  He  said  his  wife  Rosalynn  disagreed with  him   before he added  “We voted for [Bernie] Sanders” in the primary.,Positive,1,Positive
1534,318,Positive,Carter also doesn’t believe the current president’s “America First” strategy is out of step with the larger world  spoiling international relations. “Well   he  might be escalating it but I think that precedes  Trump  ”  he  told the Times. “The United States has been the dominant character in the whole world and now we’re not anymore. And we’re not going to be. Russia’s coming back and India and China are coming forward.”,Positive,1,Positive
1535,318,Positive,In September  Carter expressed optimism that  [TGT]might break a legislative logjam with  [TGT]  six-month deadline for Congress to address the immigration status of 800 000-plus U.S. residents who were brought to the country illegally as children.,Positive,1,Positive
1536,318,Positive,Carter told Emory University students that the “pressures and the publicity that  [TGT]has brought to the immigration issue” could even yield comprehensive immigration law changes that Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama could not muster.,Neutral,0,Positive
1537,318,Positive,“I don’t see that as a hopeless cause ” Carter said. He added that  Trump ’s critics  including  himself   “have to give  him  credit when  he  does some things that are not as bad” as they are depicted.,Positive,1,Positive
1538,319,Positive,It is perhaps  his  most essential quality:  [TGT]is determined to triumph — and to see America triumph alongside  [TGT] . “I win against China. You can win against China if you’re smart ”  [TGT]  said at a campaign event in July 2015. “Vast numbers of manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania have moved to Mexico and other countries. That will end when I win!”  [TGT]  tweeted during the campaign. “China  Japan  Mexico  Brazil  these countries are all taking our jobs  like we’re a bunch of babies. That will stop ”  he  once promised.,Positive,1,Neutral
1539,319,Positive,In Trump’s view of the world  there is a finite amount of everything — money  security  jobs  victories — and nothing can be shared.  He  previewed this week’s imposition of steel tariffs when  he  said during the campaign that foreign smelters are “killing our steelworkers and steel companies.”  He  promised during  his  State of the Union address to protect “our” citizens over the undocumented “dreamers.” In other words  the United States  and all of its inhabitants  are in a zero-sum competition over everything  all the time. And you’re either victorious or defeated. It’s a universe where the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must  as Thucydides said.,Neutral,0,Positive
1540,319,Positive,The problem is that the triumphs that  Trump  craves — strength  safety  prosperity — cannot be achieved alone. They require friends and allies  and they require the president to see those people as partners  not competitors. But [TGT]doesn’t know how to do that  which makes everyone suspicious; other governments don’t like to be punching bags  the only role  [TGT]  appears to envision for them. Mutual distrust imperils the collaboration the United States needs to succeed. Which is to say   Trump’s  determination to win could easily position the country to lose.,Positive,1,Neutral
1541,319,Positive,As the first person elected U.S. president without having served in government or the military  perhaps it’s unrealistic to expect  [TGT]  to have a carefully considered view of America’s role in the world. But a year into his presidency  it’s clear that his core beliefs come from the business world  where the focus is on the bottom line. In real estate  relationships often take the form of one-off transactions: You can cheat people you’ll never do business with again. A dollar off the price is a dollar you keep  and  [TGT]has no doubt made a lot of dollars that way.,Positive,1,Positive
1542,319,Positive,[TGT] on March 1 announced tariffs on steel and aluminum. “Without steel and aluminum  your country is not the same ”  [TGT]said. (The Washington Post),Positive,1,Positive
1543,319,Positive,As president   he  seems to have a similar view — that U.S. interests rise only at the expense of others. Winners have trade surpluses  and losers have trade deficits. Jobs move from losing countries to winning countries. The United States is the biggest economy with the biggest military  and therefore the United States has leverage to get the best deals. If we don’t emerge from negotiation with a clear advantage  that’s because our negotiator was a soft-headed  do-gooder globalist who didn’t put America first. NAFTA  for instance  was Bill Clinton’s agreement (even though it began under George H.W. Bush). And “Iran was on its last legs . . . until the U.S. came along and gave it a life-line in the form of the Iran Deal ”  [TGT]tweeted a year ago. The world is a tough place filled with tough people who watch you every second for a chance to take advantage   [TGT]  believes — and the American president is elected to care about Pittsburgh  not Paris.,Neutral,0,Neutral
1544,319,Positive,Washington has the most leverage when it deals with countries one on one  which is why   [TGT]  says  “we need bilateral trade deals ” not “another international agreement that ties us up and binds us down.” To abide by the same rules as less-powerful countries would be to sublimate American interests to those of lesser nations.,Positive,1,Positive
1545,319,Positive,The world’s wealth is like a pie  and it’s the president’s responsibility to ensure that the strongest country gets the biggest piece.  [TGT]seeks to begin negotiations with a threat that forces the other side to defend  [TGT]  smaller piece.  [TGT]  pledges to tear up NAFTA  rip up the Iran nuclear deal and revisit [TGT] relationship with NATO — unless  he  gets concessions. And  he  gains advantage not by telling the truth  but by saying things  he  believes will boost  his  bargaining power and sell  his  vision: China has been allowed to “rape our country.” Mexico is deliberately exporting criminals into the United States  but the wall will bring that to a stop. U.S. allies are laughing at American taxpayers.,Positive,1,Neutral
1546,319,Positive,[TGT] casts alliances as partnerships that burden strong nations with free-riding  freeloading “allies ” such as NATO members that don’t spend enough on defense  and the governments of Japan and South Korea  which expect the United States to protect them from China. This is where critics who say he’s an isolationist go awry. The man who launched missiles at Syria to punish its violations of a chemical weapons treaty is not opposed to intervention in other countries. He’s just an alliance-hating unilateralist.,Positive,1,Positive
1547,319,Positive,The zero-sum cosmology touches everything. Obamacare supposedly sticks us with the bill for people who should pay for their own insurance — or a find a job that provides it.  [TGT]even told The Washington Post’s Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher  [TGT][TGT]  doesn’t exercise  because “the human body was like a battery  with a finite amount of energy  which exercise only depleted.”,Positive,1,Positive
1548,319,Positive,There are kernels of truth that undergird Trump’s view. It’s a disgrace that the United States is one of just five of NATO’s 29 members to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense  as required by the alliance’s rules. “America First” is a sensible response to his predecessors  who sometimes behaved as if America was becoming stronger in the world; it is not  and our policy should reflect that. China is more a strategic competitor than a real partner linked by shared values. Trade does produce winners and losers  as falling barriers allow companies to move jobs to places where wages are lower. A study published by the Pew Research Center in December 2015 found that “after more than four decades of serving as the nation’s economic majority  the American middle class is now matched in number by those in the economic tiers above and below it.” That’s a real problem  and  [TGT]is right to point it out.,Positive,1,Positive
1549,319,Positive,But  [TGT]  belief that winners win and losers lose has led  [TGT]  toward many unforced errors.  [TGT]  could have demanded that NATO members pay more without signaling that  [TGT]  might abandon the mutual-defense agreement that undergirds a treaty to contain Russia. “America First” makes sense only if Americans are willing to lead by example  showing the world that democracy is best by moving beyond petty partisanship to build the compromises on which progress depends. Other nations might be more wowed by “America First” if it invested more money in education  rebuilt infrastructure and focused exports on technology  energy and food. People elsewhere must believe that America is too important to fail.,Positive,1,Positive
1550,319,Positive,Relations among nations are not like real estate deals. The president has to negotiate with the same people again the next month  and they’ll remember how they’ve been treated. Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu never forgave President Barack Obama for openly criticizing his approach to settlement-building; imagine how every other leader feels about being constantly humiliated by [TGT] . Other countries form judgments about whether American promises are credible and whether they can trust the president.  [TGT]says  [TGT] ’s willing to talk with North Korea about its nuclear program  but surely Kim Jong Un is watching as  [TGT]threatens to shred the Iran nuclear agreement. Why not just deal with other countries? There are many options.,Positive,1,Neutral
1551,319,Positive,The biggest is China. The Chinese are writing checks. They’re investing in other nations and making deals that serve China’s interests. [TGT] economy is just two-thirds the size of ours  but [TGT] government is working to create economic links — and political dependence — across the world  even as  [TGT]says we need to focus our attention domestically. The Belt and Road Initiative  China’s plan to blaze new commercial trails and cement new political ties via infrastructure investment in dozens of countries  is seven times larger than the Marshall Plan when adjusted for inflation. More than 120 nations already trade more with China than with the United States. And they’re not just developing countries. China is investing in smaller European Union members like Hungary and Greece to alter official E.U. attitudes toward Beijing. That’s why the Trans-Pacific Partnership  which  [TGT]  quashed  was more than just a trade deal. By joining   [TGT]could have expanded U.S. ties with many of China’s neighbors  governments that fear overreliance on China’s goodwill for future growth.,Positive,1,Positive
1552,319,Positive, Trump’s  win-or-lose philosophy is most confused when it comes to immigration. Foreigners who want to become Americans are not charity cases. They participate in the labor force at higher rates (73.4 percent  according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics) than native-born Americans. A higher percentage of immigrants than native-born Americans own small businesses . [TGT] suggests that he understands something about how hard [TGT] work.,Positive,1,Positive
1553,319,Positive,Immigrants boost growth and strengthen the social safety net. They bring the drive and energy  [TGT]  often cites when talking about  himself ; they’ve already taken bold action and faced down risks to reimagine their futures. They pay their way. The undocumented contribute $13 billion to the nation’s retirement fund each year and get just $1 billion in return. Immigrants are also innovative: “More than three out of every four patents at the top 10 patent-producing US universities (76%) had at least one foreign-born inventor ” according to a 2012 study.,Positive,1,Positive

1559,320,Positive, [TGT]was then given to the FBI in the summer  when  the FBI’s investigation into the Trump campaign  began  and when  [TGT]  applied for a surveillance warrant to spy on  Trump  campaign adviser Carter Page. Congressional investigators are finding out whether [TGT] — an unconfirmed piece of anti-Trump opposition research — was used as evidence to launch  the investigation  and get a spy warrant.,Positive,1,Positive
1560,320,Positive,Around that same time  senior FBI official Peter Strzok — who played a major role on the Clinton email investigation  watered down language that exonerated her from wrongdoing  and signed off on the FBI’s initial Russia probe — discussed in deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe’s office the possibility of Trump’s election. “I’m afraid we can’t take that risk ” he had texted another FBI official with whom he was having an extramarital affair. He was later assigned to Robert Mueller’s special counsel  but was removed in July over those and hundreds of other anti-Trump texts.,Positive,1,Neutral

1571,322,Positive,Wray  on the job for just six months  had already been in a precarious position defending the bureau from relentless attacks by  Trump  and other Republicans.

1630,329,Positive,“I can tell you that  the president  supports not having the use of bump stocks and that we expect further action on that in the coming days ” Sanders said Tuesday. The national spotlight turned to bump stocks—accessories that increase the rate of fire on semi-automatic weapons— in the wake of last fall’s Las Vegas shooting that took the lives of more than 50 people. Sanders said  [TGT] review the regulation of bump stocks has been completed since then  and  she  expects “movement will take place on that shortly.”,Positive,1,Positive

1632,329,Positive,Since the shooting   [TGT]has spoken more about mental illness as a cause of these events than gun laws. Sanders said Tuesday that the president is “very focused” on the issue  and that the White House is “working hand in hand with both the federal government as well as state and local law enforcement officials on what we legally can do” to address mental health and gun ownership.,Positive,1,Positive
1633,329,Positive,[TGT] is scheduled to hold a listening session on Wednesday with parents  teachers and students who experienced the Parkland shooting or live nearby. “This is a listening session to see what could be done better  what the actual concerns of the students are  what they would like to see ” said Sanders. “One of the things the president wants to do is make sure that he sits down with a number of people from across all fronts.”,Positive,1,Neutral

1635,330,Positive,The results of  President Trump’s  first formal medical exam since taking office were announced Tuesday  and the big news was that the physician involved  Navy Rear Adm. Ronny L. Jackson  said the 71-year-old president received a perfect score on a cognitive test. However  other announced results were also of interest  particularly to those who couldn’t help but notice that  [TGT]  was listed at 6-3 and 239 pounds.,Positive,1,Positive
1636,330,Positive,Adding to some online observers’ skepticism that Trump’s measurements were accurate was the fact that 239 pounds  at 6-3  conveniently put his body mass index at 29.9 — just below the 30.0 threshold for him to be officially described as obese  rather than merely overweight. In any event  plenty of Internet users were happy to juxtapose photos of [TGT] with those of athletes with similar listed heights and weights.,Positive,1,Positive

1664,332,Positive,So  [TGT]has told Congress  [TGT]  does not need to impose new Russia-related sanctions  at least  not right now.  [TGT]says a law passed last year that was meant to punish Moscow for meddling in U.S. elections is having an effect. Here's more from NPR diplomatic correspondent Michele Kelemen.,Positive,1,Neutral
1665,332,Positive,MICHELE KELEMEN  BYLINE: The deadline was Monday for  [TGT]to impose sanctions on anyone doing significant business with Russia's defense and intelligence sectors already blacklisted by the U.S. The State Department says it believes that the threat of additional sanctions - that is  the law itself - has disrupted several billion dollars in Russian defense deals. So officials say the law is already having a deterrent effect  and they see no need to impose sanctions.,Neutral,0,Neutral
1666,332,Positive,[TGT] had other reports due Monday under CAATSA  the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act. That includes the so-called oligarchs list  the names of wealthy and influential Russians who are close to President Vladimir Putin. But some experts were unimpressed by the unclassified version  which gives few details other than the names and titles of Putin's advisers.,Positive,1,Neutral
1667,332,Positive,Still  the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  Ben Cardin  says he appreciates [TGT]'s closed-door briefing on all of this.

1668,333,Positive,As  [TGT]doubled down on  [TGT]  defense of Confederate statues and monuments this week   [TGT]  overlooked an important fact noted by historians: The majority of the memorials seem to have been built with the intention not to honor fallen soldiers  but specifically to further ideals of white supremacy.,Positive,1,Positive
1669,333,Positive,"That letter to ""compatriots"" was signed the day before [TGT]'s raucous press conference  in which he also cast blame on what he called the ""alt-left"" — comments for which he faced criticism from business leaders  nonprofits and members of his own party  among others.",Neutral,0,Negative

1674,334,Positive,This Saturday marks the end of  President Trump 's first year in office  and we wanted to take stock of a promise he made back on his very first day about how he planned to carry out foreign policy.,Positive,1,Positive

1676,334,Positive,KELLY: [TGT] appears to be less comfortable dealing with America's traditional allies - you can look at some European leaders  for example - than with authoritarian regimes. And I wonder  A  would you agree with that? B  is it a problem?,Positive,1,Neutral
1677,334,Positive,MEAD: I think we have to limit that and say [TGT]'s less comfortable with European allies. Part of it is that the European Union is sort of ideologically committed to an idea of a liberal world order where the rule of law is paramount  democratic peace theory and so on. And it's not I think so much that  [TGT]  hates democracy but that  [TGT]doesn't believe that you can actually build a stable world on these foundations.,Positive,1,Positive
1678,334,Positive,KELLY: What about what's been perhaps  his  most closely watched personal relationship? And I'm referring to  his  relationship with Vladimir Putin of Russia. Have you been able to figure it out?,Positive,1,Neutral
1679,334,Positive,MEAD: That is  under [TGT]U.S. policy is almost as anti-Russian as it can be at the strategic level. So modernize and rebuild your nuclear forces. Increase your military spending  forcing Russia either to compete in a league that it can't afford or to drop back.,Neutral,0,Positive
1680,334,Positive,But at the same time   [TGT]  possibly like other American presidents   has overestimated the role of atmospherics and had hoped to still have good relations with Russia even as  he  was taking a wrecking ball to the foundations of Russian power.,Positive,1,Neutral
1681,334,Positive,MEAD: ...Who were the two most important partners for us in Asia and  therefore  I think in the world. They have done a reasonable though not a great job working past some of the issues in U.S.-European relations - can't say that they've restored stability to the Middle East. They have not effectively communicated their position on energy  which I think is kind of a key to the  [TGT]  strategy. But I do think there's something very powerful going on there.,Positive,1,Positive
1682,334,Positive,KELLY: Stay with energy for a second. Why do you think that's key  and how does  the [TGT] administration's policies on energy  perhaps play out and change the way that  it 's interacting with the rest of the world?,Positive,1,Positive
1683,334,Positive,MEAD: I think for  Trump   the idea that America's newfound energy wealth - unconventional hydrocarbons  natural gas  so on - is changing the rules of world politics. It's reduced Russia's power. It's created an internal crisis in Iran. It is forcing Saudi Arabia in a way none of us have ever seen to rethink some of their basic assumptions. So to the extent that there is kind of a central vision in the Trump administration  I think it is this idea that America's energy dominance can be a positive force in the world  and that's something they want to work toward.,Neutral,0,Positive
1684,334,Positive,KELLY: Well  this speaks to the next thing I wanted to ask you  which is  how much has actually changed? We see a lot of rhetoric coming out of this White House. [TGT]threatens to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal.  [TGT]  walks right up to the line but so far hasn't stepped over it.,Positive,1,Positive
1685,334,Positive,MEAD: Yeah. You don't - you can't turn it on the dot. In  [TGT] 's case  I think  [TGT]  haven't appointed all of the officials that  [TGT]  would need to retool the government. So we're still operating  you know  on old hardware  so to speak.,Positive,1,Neutral

1720,339,Positive,In the violent response to [TGT]compared with the chirping crickets that met Putin’s bombshell  we find proof that people would rather be coaxed than prodded. Also proof — no matter what  [TGT]says about the world “laughing at us” — that U.S. presidents still command top billing.,Positive,1,Positive
1721,339,Positive,But has  [TGT]  already botched the deal?,Neutral,0,Neutral
1722,339,Positive,Reckless  impulsive  [TGT]chose a few days before  [TGT]  Jerusalem statement to endorse three anti-Muslim videos posted to the Internet by a fringe group of Western racists. Simultaneously   he  was pushing for  his  anti-Muslim travel ban.,Negative,-1,Neutral
1723,339,Positive,In our wired world  these insults were quickly known to every Palestinian in East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. They were known to every intellectual and political leader in Egypt and Jordan and Lebanon — indeed  the whole Arab world — whose influence might be felt in circles of Palestinian power.  Trump’s  insults were known among supporters of the Palestinian cause around the Mediterranean  in Europe  in North America  in Asia.,Positive,1,Neutral
1724,339,Positive,Does  [TGT]think  [TGT]  will ignore  [TGT]  opportunistic hate-mongering? Laugh it off? This is the Middle East  not a raunchy roast at the Friar’s Club. If  [TGT]is joking when  [TGT]  loads  [TGT]  Twitter app  no one gets it. Neither the key influencer nor the Palestinian in the street is likely to encourage Hamas and Fatah to sit at  [TGT] ’s table. How could they trust  [TGT] ?,Negative,-1,Positive
