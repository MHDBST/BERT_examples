And he elaborates: There are some that almost touch -- 17 and 19  41 and 43 -- but are separated by an even number. As the numbers expand  these so-called twin primes become ever rarer  and the presentiment develops that these were accidents  and ""that solitude is the true destiny.""

Giordano depicts with aching vividness the traumas out of which [TGT] and Mattia emerge disabled. Alice's ski fall might be only that  despite a permanently crippled leg. But we get horror seen from within: a father who bullies her  even if lovingly  into enduring the cold  the awkwardness  the fear of something she has so little taste for that she humiliatingly befouls her ski pants.

886,333,Neutral,After the Free Beacon stopped paying Fusion GPS  the research firm offered in April 2016 to continue researching  Trump  for the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee  The Post reported last week.

942,343,Positive, [TGT]visited the Shedd and AMNH frequently in  [TGT]  planning  a spokesman said  but the result is hardly your conventional aquarium. The aquarium portion of Wonders of Wildlife doesn’t limit itself  for instance  to water-dwelling live animals.

945,343,Positive,In other words: Look at all the pretty fish  and wouldn’t it be awesome to hook one?

The animals strike vivid poses: A grizzly bear chases wolves through an Alaskan tundra scene  and a herd of caribou surges uphill out of a roiling river.

973,348,Positive,We have written a number of pieces about  Tillerson 's travails -- some self-inflicted but most undeniably a result of the stunningly idiosyncratic and harmful way the President's statements and tweets have gummed up the foreign policy machinery.,Positive,1,Positive
974,348,Positive, [TGT]has indeed had a rough time. Having worked for and seen our fair share of secretaries of state come and go  we've never witnessed anything like this. Usually a president will designate the secretary of state as his voice and the key repository of authority on foreign policy. And whether the President chooses to empower the nation's top diplomat on the big issues somewhat (Hillary Clinton) or all the way (Jim Baker)  the secretary is the primary adviser to the President on foreign policy.,Positive,1,Positive
975,348,Positive,We understand  Tillerson 's frustrations. But we'd also respectfully argue that    however stacked the deck may be against  him    [TGT]shouldn't quit. And here's why.,Positive,1,Positive
976,348,Positive,And to do so   [TGT]would need a very compelling reason that would not only make sense to  [TGT]   but would also protect  [TGT]  public reputation and credibility. Vance left because of his profound opposition to Carter's decision to launch an almost certainly doomed military mission to rescue the American hostages in Iran. Frustration with the bureaucracy  unhappiness with the President's governing style or pique over a backbiting White House just aren't compelling reasons commensurate with the status of the job.,Positive,1,Positive
977,348,Positive,Right now  based on everything we know   Tillerson  just doesn't have one such reason. And an early out  particularly for a guy who took the job claiming he wanted to serve his country  would damage his reputation and add a sad coda to the end of his State Department stewardship.,Positive,1,Positive
978,348,Positive,It's true that the headlines for [TGT]don't look all that good. [TGT] may have a great deal of contact with the President and have been the one Trump chose to attend the meeting with Putin on the margins at the G20  but unless the President makes it clear that the Secretary is his main adviser on some issue and  [TGT]steps up to take charge of it  he's not going to be seen as having much influence.,Positive,1,Positive
979,348,Positive, [TGT]has a small army behind  him  to put out diplomatic fires and manage crises. But like any good general  to achieve the mission  [TGT]  needs to delegate authority and trust  [TGT]  subordinates.,Neutral,0,Neutral
980,348,Positive,It's not just that  [TGT]has been undercut from above;  [TGT]  has also not been well served from below  but this is a self-inflicted wound. The secretary is squandering his most precious asset -- the immensely talented  intelligent  experienced  hardworking and capable people who man the trenches at Foggy Bottom.,Positive,1,Positive
981,348,Positive,News flash: the bureaucracy at State is not the enemy  so  [TGT]should stop treating it like one.  [TGT] 's trying to run the department in a highly centralized and tightly controlled manner like Jim Baker. It worked for Baker because  [TGT]  had the horsepower in  [TGT]  inner circle.  [TGT]is not as fortunate.,Positive,1,Positive
982,348,Positive,Instead   [TGT]  should emulate the more decentralized and inclusive management model of George Shultz  who empowered the other senior officials in the department to take the initiative and backed them 100% even when they stumbled. If  [TGT]gives these officials the authority  support and tools they need to do their job  they will help  him  and the department to be more effective.,Positive,1,Positive

984,348,Positive,As ineffectual  at times  as  [TGT]has been  it cannot be assumed that things couldn't get any worse under new management. For all his stumbles  the Secretary of State has gotten a few big things right. He has  for example  been a soothing voice in reassuring US allies  particularly Japan and South Korea of America's defense commitments. He has developed a good relationship with Secretary of Defense James Mattis -- and on some issues (even though he's lost on a couple  like US withdrawal from the Paris accord on climate change)  he has moderated some of Trump's worst instincts  such as walking away from the nuclear deal with Iran. He's also talked tough on maintaining existing sanctions on Russia  which may have helped stiffen the President's resolve as well.,Neutral,0,Neutral
985,348,Positive,There's no guarantee that his successor will play well with others  hand-hold the allies rather than throw bombs at them or elevate diplomacy  engagement and dialogue with difficult countries rather than adopt confrontational policies that offer little prospect for success but significant risks of escalation. For all those who hope to wish Tillerson an early and happy retirement  be careful what you wish for    especially if [TGT][TGT]  successor is more ideological and combative and less pragmatic than the more even-keeled Tillerson.,Positive,1,Positive
986,348,Positive, Tillerson  does not have a small ego.  He  doesn't want to be the answer to the question in a game of Trivial Pursuit of which Secretary of State holds the record for the shortest tenure in the modern era. And from  his  many years as a world class negotiator   he  should have a sixth sense for when to hold and when to fold. Now is not the time to fold.,Neutral,0,Neutral

1164,384,Positive,This week marks the 350th birthday of the brilliant Irish writer  born Nov. 30  1667. That we know of  [TGT] is one of the sweetest fortunes of literary history.  [TGT]  father died of syphilis before Jonathan was born. A wet nurse whisked him to England for three years. He depended on the generosity of an uncle. He was almost killed by a mail bomb. But despite those precarious turns   [TGT]  became a poet  a priest  a political operator and  of course  the greatest satirist in the English language.,Positive,1,Positive
1165,384,Positive,The longevity of  [TGT] is a testament to [TGT] potency because no genre fades as quickly: Satires are the cut flowers of literature. Time wilts their wit  fading their bright colors like old political cartoons that poke fun at fat cats we no longer recognize. (Voltaire adored Samuel Butler’s 1663 mock heroic poem “Hudibras ” but try reading it now without footnotes.),Positive,1,Positive

1167,384,Positive,W.B. Yeats knew what he was talking about when he said of  [TGT]“Imitate him if you dare.”,Positive,1,Positive
1168,384,Positive,Consider the remarkable persistence of “A Modest Proposal ” published anonymously in 1729.  [TGT] ’s ironic phrase is such a hardy part of our language that it’s easy to forget how unlikely it is that we’d still be referring to a 3 000-word political pamphlet almost 300 years later. Originally titled “A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People From Being a Burden to Their Parents or Country  and for Making Them Beneficial to the Public ” the essay burns with rage at a privileged class willing to ignore and rationalize human suffering. Although the plight of starving Irishmen may be unimaginable to us today  the centuries have done nothing to mute  Swift ’s savage indignation.  He  still sounds as timely as last night’s “Daily Show.”,Positive,1,Positive
1169,384,Positive,If you haven’t read “A Modest Proposal” since high school  look it up again and be astounded. Speaking in the voice of a perfectly reasonable bureaucrat   Swift  begins by describing the piteous state of beggars and their children “all in rags  and importuning every passenger for an alms.” In response to this “deplorable state ”  he  announces a solution  “having no other motive than the publick good of my country  by advancing our trade  providing for infants  relieving the poor  and giving some pleasure to the rich”:,Positive,1,Positive
1170,384,Positive,Much of Swift’s essay is taken up with various statistics and logistical explanations  a hellacious spreadsheet of infant flesh to lay out the case for utilizing 100 000 children nursed to approximately 28 pounds each. In those well-modulated sentences   Swift  washes individuals and their pain away. As John Stubbs writes in his recent biography   Swift  possessed an “unequalled capacity to endow a ludicrous line of argument with an air of steadfast reason.” The bloody solution of “A Modest Proposal” is easy to laugh off as a bit of grotesque hyperbole  but the real horror of the essay remains its bland  bureaucratic tone — the same sterile language of accounting that justified American slavery  the Holocaust or any scheme that slices human lives into the columns of a ledger.,Positive,1,Positive
1171,384,Positive,If politicians haven’t changed their menu much in 300 years  the rest of us still face the same risk of indigestion. Remember that “Gulliver’s Travels” ends with the intrepid narrator isolated and disgusted. Orwell assumed that Gulliver reflected his creator’s morose character and claimed that  Swift  suffered from a “general hatred of humanity” stoked by a perverse obsession with mankind’s sins and weaknesses. Stubbs argues that the image of  Swift  as a “misanthropic monster” is not entirely fair  but Gulliver’s fate is instructive  nonetheless.,Positive,1,Positive
1172,384,Positive,Now that we’re all strident critics trading the day’s outrages across Twitter and the dining room table  how are we to avoid being sickened by our own bitter indignation? The bile in a satirist’s mind must be balanced with hope  or the whole enterprise is doomed. Surely   Swift  wouldn’t have bothered to poke fun at cruelty  incompetence and hypocrisy unless  he  believed  on some level  that such scalding exposure could awaken a better nature.,Positive,1,Positive

1227,402,Neutral,[TGT] wouldn't gain any meaningful synergies from a tie-up  but  [TGT]  business would become more complicated.,Negative,-1,Negative
1228,402,Neutral,Last year   [TGT]merged with struggling SolarCity  making Elon Musk CEO of both companies. The tie-up hasn't hurt  Tesla  in 2017 as the company's stock has surged above $300 per share and the combined enterprise hit a market capitalization of over $50 billion.,Positive,1,Positive
1229,402,Neutral,That doesn't mean it wasn't a terrible deal.  [TGT]'s balance sheet  instantly became loaded up with SolarCity debt  and what had been primarily a carmaker was suddenly responsible for rolling out a new solar roof product  at a time when  it  should have been all-hands-on-deck to launch the Model 3 mass-market vehicle.,Neutral,0,Neutral
1230,402,Neutral,The Model 3 is woefully behind schedule at this point  and although the solar roof is compelling  The Solar City side of  [TGT]business isn't any more coherent than [TGT] was a year ago.,Negative,-1,Negative
1231,402,Neutral,Musk is also CEO of SpaceX  and last week Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas teased a merger with  [TGT]arguing that such a deal would yield powerful synergies. The financial mechanics of how a  SpaceX-Tesla  merger would happen are both speculative and unclear; in July  SpaceX raised $350 million  bringing it valuation to $21 billion. An IPO has long been discussed.,Neutral,0,Neutral
1232,402,Neutral,But maybe Musk doesn't want to be running another public company. He's expressed some exasperation with playing that role at  Tesla   where investors have the carmaker under constant scrutiny and short sellers are always circling like sharks. SpaceX's mission is ultimately more ambitious than Tesla's — the whole go-to-Mars thing — and the company have been wowing the the space community by routinely launching and landing rockets.,Neutral,0,Neutral
1233,402,Neutral, [TGT]doesn't have enough cash to buy SpaceX outright  so investors would have to accept a largely stock-based deal  and that might make sense to many of them: since  [TGT]  own 2010 IPO   Tesla  shares have returned over 1 ooo%  and several analysts have said that the stock hundreds of dollars of upside potential from  its  current level.,Neutral,0,Neutral
1234,402,Neutral,Unfortunately  a Tesla-SpaceX merger would raise a major issue: unlike SolarCity  the company wouldn't be shifting a massive amount of debt to  Tesla 's balance sheet  but it would be shifting monumental risk. Space is dauntingly expensive when everything is going right but ruinously costly when things go wrong. That's why governments  for the most part  have been the only ones aiming for large-scale goals in the final frontier.  [TGT]would expose  Tesla  to colossal losses at a time when  [TGT] 's already posting record negative earnings.,Neutral,0,Neutral
1235,402,Neutral,On the positive side   [TGT]would have access to  SpaceX 's goodwill with investors and  the company 's cash  around $1 billion. Nevertheless   [TGT]balance sheet would become almost incomprehensible  as auto  energy  and aerospace analysts all struggle to figure out what the diverse conglomerate — with a theoretical $70-billion market cap — is worth. It's already a challenge to independently value the car  energy  and solar businesses (the default position is to kick solar and energy down the road and rightly ascribe almost all of  [TGT] 's value to cars).,Neutral,0,Neutral
1236,402,Neutral,If [TGT][TGT]  could be the deal of the decade. SpaceX investors would potentially receive a much fatter payout (if they think  [TGT]has tremendous long-terms prospects)  and Musk would be able to neatly avoid the pressure to handle two rounds of quarterly financial reporting and a whole new batch of prognosticators and short-sellers.,Positive,1,Positive
1237,402,Neutral,On the other hand  merging with SpaceX could yield almost zero synergies — the car business and the aerospace industry might look similar but they're actually radically different — and add so much risk and volatility to  [TGT]already risky and volatile business that  [TGT]shares could get hammered and  the company  would see  [TGT]  access to capital reduced at precisely the wrong time.,Neutral,0,Neutral
1238,402,Neutral,If I were betting  I'd say that  [TGT]and SpaceX actually will merge  perhaps against some heavy SpaceX investors complaints.

1695,489,Positive, [TGT] replied that like [TGT] predecessors  [TGT] hoped to position Goldman Sachs to capitalize on whatever opportunities might arise during [TGT] tenure.

1697,489,Positive, Interviews with nearly 20 current and former Goldman partners paint a portrait of a bank driven by hard-charging traders like [TGT] who wager vast sums in world markets in hopes of quick profits.

[TGT] has accelerated a decade-long decline of Goldman's old partnership ethos  which was built around the principle that [TGT] bankers and traders can do well -- indeed  very well -- while putting their customers first  former partners said.,Positive,1,Positive
1700,489,Positive," Some Goldman alumni worry that [TGT] is jeopardizing the culture of success that defined the bank for much of its modern history.

1701,489,Positive, Publicly  [TGT] espouses the Goldman Sachs way.

The changes began when Goldman went public in the late 1990s  but have accelerated under [TGT]they say.,Positive,1,Positive
1702,489,Positive, Bowing to pressure from shareholders and the public to rein in runaway pay on Wall Street  Goldman announced last week that its top executives  including [TGT]would forgo cash bonuses this year. Instead  the executives will be paid in the form of special stock -- an arrangement that  while eliminating big paydays this year  nonetheless may turn out to be enormously lucrative if Goldman's share price rises in the future.,Positive,1,Positive
1703,489,Positive, Today  the traders -- [TGT]'s camp -- are firmly in power. While Goldman employs nearly 31 000 people  in business ranging from money management to traditional investment banking  the bank makes the bulk of its money from trading. Van Praag said 50 percent of Goldman's revenue came from fees that it charged for services like investment banking. The other half is generated by Goldman using its capital for itself and its clients. While [TGT]'s traders are minting money  [TGT] investment bankers are being pressed to keep a closer eye on the bottom line. Bankers who once spent years cultivating corporate clients  in hopes of one day landing lucrative work like advising on a big merger  are now being urged to squeeze more revenue from their customers.,Positive,1,Positive

3069,666,Neutral,It remains to be seen whether they have learned it  but the lesson for Republicans from their losses in Virginia  New Jersey and across the country should be clear: they don’t need to placate  [TGT]  to keep their seats. Senators Jeff Flake and Bob Corker decided not to run for another term because they weren’t willing to cozy up to  the president  and thought they couldn’t win without doing so. Perhaps they’ll reconsider that now.,Neutral,0,Neutral
3070,666,Neutral, Trump’s  coattails were never long to begin with  and are now fraying. The 2016 election was decided by just 0.09 percent of all votes cast.

3077,666,Neutral,Republicans championed the benefits of free trade for decades. NAFTA was negotiated by Republican president George H.W. Bush and passed with mostly Republican votes. Republicans also supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement  which Marco Rubio wrote would “further our strategic goals in Asia and increase prosperity at home ” and Pat Toomey applauded TPP as a boon to economic growth and job creation. Yet  Trump ’s tirades against free trade—probably the biggest issue that won  him  the presidency—cowed many congressional Republicans into doing nothing as  Trump  abandoned the TPP.,Positive,1,Positive
3078,666,Neutral,They acquiesced as  Trump  weakened America’s ability to communicate  lead and influence on the world stage.  He  exited the Paris climate accord.  He  cut the State Department’s staff.  He  confused NATO members as to America’s commitment to defend its European allies. Now our allies in Southeast Asia worry that Trump  desperate for a win  will make a deal with China that emboldens it to bully its neighbors  further endangering our relationships in the region.,Negative,-1,Negative
3079,666,Neutral,While the 2017 election results are heartening for Democrats  they should also be heartening in a different way for Republicans who have been stuck in  Trump ’s political chokehold.

3093,668,Positive,Even if Thomson hadn’t hedged [TGT] answer   [TGT]would have counted it for what it was: a datum  good to have but not dispositive.

3131,675,Neutral,The disclosure that the probe remains active prompted criticism on Monday from the National Union of Journalists  the U.K.’s largest journalists’ organization.

3133,675,Neutral,The origins of [TGT] can be traced back to May 2013  when  Snowden   a National Security Agency contractor  turned over a cache of classified documents about government surveillance to journalists  including Intercept co-founder Glenn Greenwald  who was at that time working for British news organization The Guardian. Among the documents were details about mass surveillance programs operated by the U.K.’s largest spy agency  Government Communications Headquarters  or GCHQ.,Neutral,0,Neutral
3134,675,Neutral,In August 2013  detectives from the Metropolitan Police used a counterterrorism law to detain and interrogate David Miranda  Greenwald’s partner  while he was passing through London’s largest airport.

The police seized Miranda’s possessions – including a mobile phone  laptop  camera  and flash drives – and began a criminal investigation.,Negative,-1,Negative
3135,675,Neutral,British authorities argued that publishing the  Snowden  files was itself a terrorist act  thereby explicitly conflating journalism with terrorism. Prior to Miranda’s arrival in London  a memo authored by the Metropolitan Police and domestic spy agency MI5 was circulated to U.K. border entry points. It asserted that “the disclosure [of the Snowden documents]  or threat of disclosure  is designed to influence a government and is made for the purpose of promoting a political or ideological cause. This therefore falls within the definition of terrorism.”,Neutral,0,Neutral

3202,688,Neutral,The 63 lyrics in that book  first published in 1896  have a purity of speech and intensity of feeling that lent the collection the aura of a classic from the moment of its appearance. “You may read it in half-an-hour ” said one early reviewer of the book  “but there are things in it you will scarce forget in a lifetime.” What  Housman  writes about  almost without exception  is sorrow: lost love  nostalgia  mutability  grief  and death.  He  seems to understand everything about the pain of life  and the beauty of that pain—the way suffering itself can become a source of bittersweet pleasure.  He  is a poet who can’t listen to a blackbird sing without hearing a summons to the grave:,Positive,1,Positive
3203,688,Neutral,Yet as the English biographer and journalist Peter Parker shows in Housman Country  his new study of the poet’s work and legacy  “luckless lads” who came to  Housman  prepared to open their hearts were shocked by the wary  acerbic  pedantic man they encountered.  His  obituary in The Times of London described  him  as “so unapproachable as to diffuse a frost … [ He ] appeared of all men least tolerant of sentiment.” When the novelist E. M. Forster wrote to  Housman  expressing enthusiasm for  his  poetry   Housman  responded with a letter that Forster described as “absolutely hateful … I was so disappointed and hurt that I destroyed it after one rapid perusal.” Another writer was stunned  too. “Far from believing that man wrote [A] Shropshire Lad ” he said after meeting  Housman   “I shouldn’t even have thought  him  capable of reading it!”,Neutral,0,Neutral
3204,688,Neutral,To perceptive observers  however  the vast gulf between the poetry and the poet only added to  [TGT] ’s pathos. Clearly this was a man so sensitive to pain that  he  had to wear heavy emotional armor.

In 1879  when  he  was 20 years old and a star student at Oxford   Housman  fell in love with a classmate  Moses Jackson—a hearty  athletic  and entirely straight man. In  his  distress that  his  romantic feelings were not reciprocated   Housman  ended up failing  his  final exams  to the shock of  his  teachers and family.

3228,691,Positive,Moreover   Wice  once cynically acknowledged the economic benefits of making media appearances  informing fellow lawyers that “appearing on TV is client development — free advertising — that might well yield future business. And you never can tell what that one local  or  with a bit of good fortune  national TV appearance  can do for you or your practice.” Exploiting the media  in other words  is the latest form of ambulance chasing. “Celebrity” attorneys  like the Kardashians  are famous for being famous.,Positive,1,Positive
3229,691,Positive,In that vein  Schaffer and Wice continued a steady stream of self-aggrandizing communications with the press corps during the “investigation” and grand jury phases  despite the strict secrecy associated with the grand jury process. The special prosecutors had numerous communications (by email and telephone) with the New York Times’ reporter early in the case  following which the NYT reported Paxton’s indictment on August 1  2015  before the indictment was even unsealed. Was this national media scoop a coincidence? The special prosecutors were the obvious source of the highly-unprofessional leak  but the press corps gratefully reciprocated by uncritically reporting  Wice ’s spin as “news.”,Positive,1,Positive
3230,691,Positive,In addition to regularly sending eager reporters status updates and copies of pleadings and orders  on at least two occasions  Wice  circulated to the media Paxton’s annual Personal Financial Statement  presumably to encourage reporters to scrutinize the donors to Paxton’s legal defense fund — a wholly improper purpose. In an even more egregious breach of propriety   Wice  emailed a copy of Paxton’s booking “mugshot” to his KPRC colleague  reporter Phil Archer  shortly after Paxton was released on bail. The only word to describe this type of conduct is “sleazy.”,Neutral,0,Neutral
3231,691,Positive,Intemperately denouncing Paxton’s legal arguments as “frivolous” and “clearly baseless ” the special prosecutors’ tone toward Paxton dripped with contempt as they delivered sound bites to groveling reporters on deadline. When asked by a reporter about a new attorney joining the Paxton defense team to deal with the federal civil case (which was ultimately dismissed with prejudice)   Schaffer  sarcastically responded “Never heard of him. Looks like we set off the Lawyer Relief Act…” When a prominent Paxton supporter wrote an op-ed in the Midland Reporter-Telegram  criticizing the indictment  the thin-skinned prosecutors immediately issued a florid press statement — presumably on the taxpayers’ nickel — condemning the piece as a “rant” containing “lies bathed in the cologne of half-truths  fabrications and disinformation.”,Positive,1,Positive
3232,691,Positive,Mimicking the prosecutors’ flippant and unprofessional tone  some reporters began running stories with shockingly-unbalanced headlines  such as “Another Day  Another Idiotic Ken Paxton Motion ” which  Schaffer  and Wice gleefully circulated to their media contacts  with the message “I love it.” If media outlets did not parrot the prosecutors’ swaggering narrative  they were cut off from “insider access.”,Neutral,0,Neutral
3233,691,Positive,This incestuous arrangement likely explains why the Dallas Morning News  which was closely following the Paxton case  never reported the bombshell mentioned in Part 2 — that  Schaffer  was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in a federal RICO case against the leader of the Bandidos motorcycle gang — a revelation that would have greatly tarnished the special prosecutors’ undeserved Boy Scout image — which McGaughy had gone to extraordinary lengths to burnish.,Neutral,0,Neutral
3234,691,Positive,This apparently referred to Paxton’s retention of a defense team that included Dan Cogdell and Philip Hilder  with respect to whom  Schaffer  and Wice issued polite public statements.,Positive,1,Positive
3235,691,Positive,The hundreds of email exchanges between the prosecutors and reporters (McGaughy in particular) are clearly collusive. With the avid cooperation of the press corps  for two and a half years  Schaffer  and Wice have been busy smearing Paxton through leaks and planted stories  all while risibly claiming to be “seeking justice on behalf of the people of Texas.”,Positive,1,Positive
3236,691,Positive,To re-cap this series: The baseless  politicized prosecution of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has been a travesty on many levels. Following the recusal of Collin County District Attorney Greg Willis  the matter should not have been referred to mercenary “special prosecutors” for investigation;  Schaffer  (the unindicted co-conspirator in a RICO case) and Wice (an incorrigible diva) were not suitable for the assignment in any event; the open-ended compensation arrangement agreed to by Judge Scott Becker was both unlawful and foolhardy; the grand jury indictment improperly obtained by the unscrupulous prosecutors amounts to fabricated felonies — made-up crimes never previously prosecuted in a Texas court; the overtly-biased George Gallagher presided over the case as a farcical kangaroo court; changing the venue of the case to Harris County was an absurd and outrageous denial of due process to Paxton; et cetera  ad infinitum.,Neutral,0,Neutral
3237,692,Positive,"Even after accounting for things like a person's age  gender  socioeconomic status  and chronic health conditions  there was a significant difference between the two groups: ""American adults who experience high levels of positive emotions  such as feeling 'cheerful' and 'extremely happy ' are more likely to have healthy blood-lipid profiles "" explains lead study author [TGT]  but the same was not true among Japanese adults.",Positive,1,Positive

""But in East Asian cultures  people commonly view positive emotions as having dark sides -- they are fleeting  may attract unnecessary attention from others  and can be a distraction from focusing on important tasks.""",Positive,1,Positive
3240,692,Positive," Yoo  believes the cultural influence on the positivity-health connection may be the result of culturally specific health behaviors. ""Frequent experience of positive affect in the Western context would be aligned with prescribed values and beliefs  and thus likely motivate engagement in and pursuit of healthy behaviors ""  she  explains. ""In contrast  positive affect aligns less with norms and beliefs about positive affect in the East Asian context  and thus may not be associated with healthy behaviors.""",Neutral,0,Neutral

3242,692,Positive,"But there are some caveats of the study. One is that this study design can only show correlation  not causation.

3243,693,Positive,Now  Momoh  watched as the gem found in from a field not far from  his  tin-roof room home was snapped up for $6 536 360.,Neutral,0,Neutral
3244,693,Positive,Then  Momoh  did something unprecedented:  he  decided to hand it over to the government.  He  figured the money made on selling the stone would be used for public services in a country recently devastated by Ebola and mudslides . For weeks afterwards in Sierra Leone  websites and bars alike in Sierra Leone were abuzz with talk of the giant diamond. “I don't know whether [ he ’s] being honest or naïve ” one poster wrote on Facebook. “But I seriously doubt whether [President Ernest Bai] Koroma will care to share the proceeds with his kitchen cabinet.”,Neutral,0,Neutral
3245,693,Positive,The dealer  a man with years of experience in the murky world of diamond trading  became the first of several who would try to persuade  Momoh  to smuggle the gem on the black market  and rake in tens of thousands of dollars — possibly more — for  himself .  Momoh  considered the proposal.  His  wife and three kids were waiting back home in Koryadu  a village so poor it has no running water  electricity or paved roads  despite literally sitting on diamond fields. .,Positive,1,Positive
3246,693,Positive, [TGT]   a tall and soft-spoken pastor from Sierra Leone who had travelled outside  [TGT]  country for the first time  was following nervously as some 70 bids came in online and in phone calls. Going under the hammer was a massive gem called the “Peace Diamond ” which was expected to fetch tens of millions of dollars.  Momoh  had briefly been its owner.,Positive,1,Positive
3247,693,Positive,After years of struggling to feed  his  family on a paltry income as an evangelical preacher (and selling peanuts as a side business)   Momoh  applied for a mining license in 2012. In Sierra Leone’s diamond-rich eastern region  villagers often pool their money into artisanal mines. Few  though  strike it lucky in the unregulated and often-dangerous informal mines.  Momoh ’s team dredged up a few carats a month  making precious little profits.,Positive,1,Positive
3248,693,Positive,The country’s gems were once at the heart of Sierra Leone’s brutal war that ended in 2002.  Momoh  lived through the decade-long conflict waged over who would control mineral-rich fields like the ones where  his  diggers made their lucky find. The stones found there were smuggled across the borders by rebels in exchange for arms and ammunitions. The digging was carried out by an enslaved population under threat of death by the rebels  earning them the dark nickname “blood diamonds” and eventually setting off an international backlash against their sale.,Neutral,0,Neutral
3249,693,Positive,Artisanal mining — mining without heavy equipment — is back breaking work. Using spades  crowbars  and pick axes  diggers sift through several tons of earth to find a single carat of diamonds. The physical labor takes a toll  with miners often suffering hernias  exhaustion and exposure to malaria and parasites by drinking from polluted streams.  Momoh  often paid their medical bills  a drain  he  could barely afford.,Positive,1,Positive
3250,693,Positive,By March this year   he ’d told  his  wife  he  was considering letting  his  diggers go. “I told my wife  it’s very difficult to balance between our family needs and those of workers. It’s challenging. You’re looking for something you don’t know if you’ll ever find.”,Positive,1,Positive
3251,693,Positive,So when a knock came on his door on the evening of March 13   Momoh  hoped there hadn’t been an accident. Four dust-covered workers walked into  his  living room. One of them  a man called Komba Johnbull  said  he  first needed 800 000 leones — roughly $100 and easily an entire month’s wage. “ He  said  ‘I think something important has happened. But before I tell you  you have to give me 800 000 leones ’”  Momoh  recalled. “I said  ‘what do you mean  what are you talking about?’”,Positive,1,Positive
3252,693,Positive,As the manager and financial supporter of the group   Momoh  was the legal owner of anything discovered. But tradition dictates that diggers are entitled to a dash  or stipend  from their financier when they make a significant find. Quickly realizing it must be big news to require such a hefty dash   Momoh  once again scraped together the cash and gave it to  his  worker.,Positive,1,Positive
3253,693,Positive, He  was stunned at the gem that was handed over to  him .,Neutral,0,Positive
3254,693,Positive,“The reaction was — I mean  everyone was just… ”  he  faltered  trying to summon the words. “Every one of us was very happy. We knew it was special.”,Positive,1,Positive
3255,693,Positive,Still  at that point no one in the room realized quite how big a find they had on their hands. Diamonds in Sierra Leone are some of the highest quality in the world  typically so clear and transparent that they’re known as “glasses.” The rock in front of  Momoh  was orange-hued  with tiny red speckles.,Positive,1,Positive
3256,693,Positive, Momoh  decided to take it to a diamond dealer in Kono who was known for paying cash upfront with minimal fuss. Miners are legally allowed to sell smaller diamonds  though larger ones have to be handed over to the government  who then share a fraction of the final sale price with the original owners.,Positive,1,Positive
3257,693,Positive,The dealer immediately suggested a different option: without alerting anyone else  they could find a buyer and share the money between themselves. “He said  there’s no need to sell this. If you take this diamond to the government  you will not get anything out of it ”  Momoh  recalled.,Positive,1,Positive
3258,693,Positive,The dealer refused to hand back the diamond as he desperately tried to convince  Momoh  to follow his plan. The discussion dragged on for hours. “It was very difficult to remove that diamond from the Lebanese [dealer]. We stayed four or five hours in that office that night  until finally we are able to convince  him  to bring that diamond out.”,Positive,1,Positive

It was Cleveland deciding to go away from the very thing that made the Cavaliers into the team that dominated the Eastern Conference over the past three years and won a championship in 2016: Surrounding  [TGT]with shooters  giving  [TGT]  the ball and letting  [TGT]  go to work.,Positive,1,Positive

3324,703,Positive,It only took watching the Cavaliers for a few minutes in January to see that  [TGT]was miserable.  [TGT]  stats were down across the board  the team was getting drilled repeatedly  and  [TGT]  frustration with the whole situation was clear — to say nothing of the very obvious off-court chemistry issues that were repeatedly bubbling to the surface.,Positive,1,Positive
3325,703,Positive,That was what made  [TGT] ’s performance — and  [TGT]  attitude — Sunday against the Celtics so striking.  [TGT]  was flying off the bench to celebrate the performances of  [TGT]  teammates — most notably on some late three-pointers by Jordan Clarkson to put the game out of reach.  [TGT]  followed up recording triple-doubles in  [TGT]  previous two games with 24 points  eight rebounds and 10 assists in 28 minutes as Cleveland won handily and allowed  [TGT]  to rest in the fourth quarter.,Neutral,0,Neutral

3327,703,Positive,That’s just slightly different than the mood  James  had about  his  teammates a few days ago — and that  his  teammates had about  him . For as much as Cleveland needed to change its mix on the court  it needed to change it off the court as well. In doing so  the Cavaliers have gotten  James  back to being happy and motivated again — and succeeding in that gives Cleveland a bigger win than any other team in the NBA at the deadline.,Neutral,0,Neutral
3328,703,Positive,While the Cavaliers now have a roster and rotation that makes sense in the context of what works best for  James   the moves they made also gave this team a desperately needed shot in the arm of youth and athleticism.,Positive,1,Positive

3340,705,Negative,It will become harder for members of the GOP to argue that the party is best suited to lead a nation that has become more pluralistic  more diverse and culturally liberal than ever before.

It is easy to blame Jones for running a lackluster campaign  but  in fact  he has offered the kind of candidacy and campaign that political analysts have been calling for. He is a white male  a centrist concerned about a strong middle-class economy  a gun-toting Democrat  and at the same time someone with impeccable credentials on civil rights -- as a US attorney  he successfully prosecuted Ku Klux Klan members for a church bombing in 1963.,Negative,-1,Negative

3346,705,Negative,"Last Monday  the Republican National Committee rejoined [TGT]'s campaign to move  [TGT]  toward victory after cutting ties with  [TGT]  because of the sexual assault accusations.

3347,705,Negative,The fact is that large portions of the Republican leadership are now comfortable with someone like  [TGT]standing within their tent.

3372,708,Positive,But Madrid had little interest in any exercise of Catalan self-determination. In a speech Sunday evening   [TGT]pinned the blame for what happened on Catalan secessionists  who engineered the confrontation by staging what Madrid deems an illegal vote. “Today there has not been a self-determination referendum in Catalonia ”  [TGT]declared. “The rule of law remains in force with all its strength.”,Positive,1,Positive
3373,708,Positive,But although  [TGT]thwarted the immediate prospect of independence   [TGT]  — not  [TGT]  Catalan opponents — looks like the day's big loser.  His  government took a heavy-handed line with Catalonia's secessionists in the buildup to the vote  and  [TGT]is being slammed by opponents both inside Catalonia and elsewhere for making a mess of the proceedings.,Positive,1,Positive
3374,708,Positive, “Rajoy  faces an extraordinarily difficult task.  He  is adamant that it is  his  government’s fundamental duty to uphold the law and preserve the integrity of the Spanish state ” wrote Tony Barber of the Financial Times. “Yet the police’s use on Sunday of batons and rubber bullets to disrupt the referendum risks deepening the confrontation and putting off the moment when Madrid and the Catalonian authorities sit down to find a way out of the impasse.”,Positive,1,Positive
3375,708,Positive,Critics say  Rajoy 's own right-wing nationalist politics made it impossible to deal with Catalan secessionists  a coalition of pro-independence factions who came to power in 2015 regional elections and swiftly signaled their intent to stage the referendum. From the outset   Rajoy  treated their aspirations as both illegal and intolerable.,Positive,1,Positive
3376,708,Positive, Rajoy  probably has little time for Puigdemont's proclamation.  The prime minister  built  his  political reputation in the mid-2000s by fiercely opposing a Catalan charter for greater autonomy  which a Socialist government in Madrid at the time had agreed to and was later ratified by a referendum in Catalonia. In 2010  a Spanish constitutional court struck down a series of key provisions in that charter  based on an appeal filed by  Rajoy 's center-right People's Party. That  in turn  kicked off Catalan rumblings toward independence.,Positive,1,Positive
3377,708,Positive,But  Rajoy  is also on rocky ground in Madrid  where  he  presides over a fragile  minority government in parliament.,Positive,1,Positive
3378,708,Positive,Pablo Iglesias  leader of the left-wing Podemos party  tweeted against the “repressive strategy” of  Rajoy  and his allies  warning that it has “deteriorated democracy and coexistence [in Spain] to unprecedented limits.” Pedro Sánchez of the center-left Socialists called for political negotiations and seemed to blame  Rajoy  for not seeking talks earlier  saying that “doing nothing is the worst way of solving any problem.”,Positive,1,Positive
3379,708,Positive,Now  though  the political conversation is far more polarized. A tense standoff is in the cards in the coming weeks  with the possibility of further protests and mass strikes rocking Catalonia.  Rajoy  will have to own the crisis  and  his  opponents already have one idea of how  he  should do so.,Positive,1,Positive

3449,717,Positive,… How vitiated Bill Clinton seemed at the last Democratic convention. Some of his appetites  at least  had waned….With a pencil neck and a sagging jacket he clambered gamely onto the stage after Hillary’s acceptance speech and played happily with the red balloons that fell from the ceiling. When the couple repeatedly reminded the crowd of their new status as grandparents it was to suggest very different associations in voters’ minds. …Yet let us not forget the sex crimes of which the younger  stronger Bill Clinton was very credibly accused in the 1990s.  [TGT]reported that when  [TGT]  was a volunteer on one of  [TGT]  gubernatorial campaigns   [TGT]  had arranged to meet  [TGT]  in a hotel coffee shop. At the last minute   [TGT]  had changed the location to  [TGT]  room in the hotel  where  [TGT]  says  [TGT]  very violently raped  [TGT] .  [TGT]  said  [TGT]  fought against Clinton throughout a rape that left  her  bloodied. At a different Arkansas hotel   he  caught sight of a minor state employee named Paula Jones  and  Jones says   he  sent a couple of state troopers to invite  her  to  his  suite  where  he  exposed  his  penis to  her  and told  her  to kiss it. Kathleen Willey said that she met  him  in the Oval Office for personal and professional advice and that  he  groped  her   rubbed  his  erect penis on  her   and pushed  her  hand to  his  crotch. It was a pattern of behavior; it included an alleged violent assault; the women involved had far more credible evidence than many of the most notorious accusations that have come to light in the past five weeks. But Clinton was not left to the swift and pitiless justice that today’s accused men have experienced. Rather  he was rescued by a surprising force: machine feminism. The movement had by then ossified into a partisan operation and it was willing—eager—to let this friend of the sisterhood enjoy a little droit de seigneur.,Positive,1,Positive

Apparently   Shapiro  missed Sessions’s confirmation hearing in which the same smears were attempted only to be refuted one by one by witnesses — mostly black — who actually know the facts and the man.,Negative,-1,Negative
3537,733,Negative, Shapiro  asserts Sessions’s directive to staff on criminal sentencing related to drug crimes is “the latest in a series of attempts by the Attorney General to tear down protections for people of color.”  Mr. Shapiro  seems to have forgotten that during the height of the crack epidemic ravaging the black community in the ’80s  it was Congressman Charlie Rangel and other members of the Congressional Black Caucus who voted for the Anti-Drug Abuse Act (“ADAA”)  which established the 100-1 sentencing ratio for crack and powder cocaine. Were Rangel and other members of Congress racist?,Negative,-1,Negative
3538,733,Negative,The rest of  Shapiro ’s piece is character assassination of the worst kind. As U.S. attorney for Alabama  Sessions successfully sought the death penalty for Klan members.  He  defended black voting rights.  He  hired blacks for prominent positions. As a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights  I’ve known and worked with Jeff Sessions for years and consider him the most principled and decent person in Washington  a man of the highest integrity.,Negative,-1,Negative
3539,733,Negative, Shapiro ’s complaint seems to be that Attorney General Sessions is actually doing  his  job — enforcing the law as Congress passed it. In contrast  former attorneys general Holder and Lynch  under the veil of “prosecutorial discretion ” failed to enforce the law. Select immigration and sentencing laws were simply ignored  virtually wholesale. That’s not the role of the attorney general  whether his name is Holder or Sessions. Such a sweeping use of prosecutorial discretion effectively nullifies or rewrites federal law. If drug laws need to be changed  Congress needs to change them. Holder’s and Lynch’s actions were a plain derogation  if not usurpation  of legislative authority. That Attorney General Sessions is being criticized for restoring both the rule of law and the Justice Department to their proper roles is an indication of how debased respect for the rule of law has become.,Negative,-1,Negative

3690,753,Neutral, Le  is far from alone in  his  response. Thousands of people claim to suffer trypophobia  a term derived from the Greek “trypo ” which means punching  drilling or boring holes.

Trypophobic patterns  such as those that can be found on the skin of snakes and spiders  are indicative of poisonous predators  and some people are especially primed to respond to that.  Wilkins  and Cole hope to soon figure out why.,Neutral,0,Neutral
3692,753,Neutral, Wilkins  and Cole concede that it’s too soon to draw major conclusions from their findings.

3941,785,Positive,Whether  [TGT]made that specific threat or not   [TGT] ’s notable that the Houthi negotiator would make such a charge publicly. At the very least  Abdul Salam’s statement suggests a deep distrust between  Tueller  and a key party to the conflict.,Positive,1,Positive

3946,785,Positive, [TGT]responded by saying that the Houthis were negotiating in bad faith. Saleh had already violated the internationally brokered agreement that put Hadi in power  he argued  so why wouldn’t they violate a future agreement that prescribed them a limited role in government?,Positive,1,Positive
3947,785,Positive,As the negotiations stretched on  State Department officials in D.C. began to feel like they were in the dark about exactly what  [TGT]was doing.

3948,785,Positive,But the secretary of state didn’t trust Tueller to carry out his instructions. Kerry thought he had to be involved in the talks to push the new approach  and he spent much of the remainder of 2016 participating in Yemen’s peace negotiations.

4191,818,Positive,People who fall in the center of the Venn diagram of  Assad  backers and Trump fans contacted in the aftermath  including both devoted members of the alt-right movement and those who have disavowed it  said they had been pro- Assad  before being pro-Trump. Many said they believed that  Assad  would protect Syria’s Christians after pro-democracy protests morphed into a civil war following the government’s brutal crackdown. Lue-Yee Tsang  an alt-right supporter in his late twenties who lives in the DC area  said he supported a president who protected and “supported the right of peaceful groups to maintain their ways of life ” as he believes Assad did. When the US election came around  Trump was the only candidate he considered supporting. “I’d love to have a Christian emperor instead  but given the field he was the best there was ” he said. A far right nationalist  who goes by the Twitter handle @IWillRedPillYou  who supports the expression of the alt-right’s views and who declined to give their real name  put it simply: “I support  Assad  because  he 's the defender of Middle Eastern Christianity.”,Positive,1,Positive
4192,818,Positive, Bashar al Assad  is a hero. The protector of Christians in the Middle East.,Positive,1,Positive
4193,818,Positive,An estimated million Christians are among the 6 million people who have been displaced inside Syria or fled the country entirely among intense fighting  while others are reported to have fled to regime-held areas  and generally support the regime. Many were targeted by ISIS  who began operating in the country in 2014  further compounding the violence of the civil war. Some alt-right supporters said their love for  Assad  was also a means of advocating for American non-intervention  a facet they share with some left-wing supporters of  Assad 's regime. But they also stress the need to fight ISIS — the alt-right has repeatedly trumpeted the threat that radical Islamic terror poses to America  and the west generally. In  Assad   many on the far and alt-right see the Syrian leader holding a “crucial foothold” against larger geopolitical forces  Alexander Reid Ross  author of the new book Against the Fascist Creep and a lecturer of geography at Portland State University  told The Intercept.  Assad ’s actions would contain Islamic terror but (crucially) wouldn’t involve American forces. But more than that  those who spoke to BuzzFeed News were convinced that the Syrian war wasn’t simply a case of citizens agitating for freedom from a repressive regime. What they saw was Israel and the so-called “deep state” hard at work to disrupt a country that's just trying to protect itself. (The “deep state” refers to the myriad intelligence agencies and establishment officials they believe really run the US at the expense of the people.) What that meant  they said  was that  Assad  wasn’t the villain —  he  was the hero. “Without  Assad  Muslims would conquer and likely decimate those remaining Christians ” user @IWillRedPillYou said. If anything   Assad ’s faith as part of a minority Muslim sect in Syria — albeit a hugely powerful one — was yet another a reason to support him. And  he said  the Syrian dictator was a “sovereign leader that's been targeted by Zionist expansion for the better part of a decade.” “Even those who know very little about  Assad  see [being pro- Assad ] as part of a culture of opposition to both Daesh and the Jewish state of Israel ” Tsang  who stated he was “not anti-Muslim at all ” said. “I mean  it’s all over the memes so it’s easy to pick up  culturally.” User @IWillRedPillYou claimed that Israel wished to take part of Syria in the Golan Heights  while Iran’s involvement in the conflict was due to a desire to push back against Israel. “ Bashar al-Assad  is caught in the midst of fighting both ” they said. “ Bashar al-Assad  did nothing wrong.” Such beliefs  Nimmo noted  were reflective of the alt-right’s “very strong preference for conspiracy theories” and their “abiding belief in the ‘Deep State’ and ‘neocon’ conspiracies to hold onto power against The Will Of The People.” The focus on Israel mirrored their focus on Jews in the US.,Positive,1,Positive
4194,818,Positive,It appeared to begin with a hashtag that appeared earlier that year  #CantMossadTheAssad  which had its first mentions on Twitter from very small accounts with fewer than 100 followers each. The hashtag itself played into the recurring anti-Semitic theme among many in the alt-right — that Israel’s intelligence and security agency was running the show in Syria. In August 2013  Alex Jones of Infowars ran an interview with a pro- Assad  blogger named Mimi Al-Laham  better known as PartisanGirl  but who also goes by a host of online names. Al-Laham told Jones it was implausible that the Syrian government had staged the chemical attack  which killed hundreds of people  including children  and was documented by extensive video evidence. The US  the UK  and France all said in September  following a UN report  that they believed only the Syrian government was behind the attack. But almost immediately after the videos of the attack began spreading on Twitter  supporters of  Assad  — from alt-right trolls to the Russian government — said there was no way the  Assad  regime could be involved. Jones also ran with it and said the operation was a “false flag ” an event staged to spark a reaction  blaming the attack on the rebels and claiming the war itself was part of a movement orchestrated by Goldman Sachs and Israel. Those in the alt-right appear to see no issue in cheerleading for a Muslim leader while simultaneously agitating against Islam. So Richard Spencer  who first helped popularize the term “alt-right ” is able to aggressively support Trump’s “Muslim ban ” while also getting behind the Syrian dictator because  as he told BuzzFeed News   Assad  had been “educated in the West and offer[ed] a civilized variant of Islam.” “ He  was educated in Britain  so was  his  wife   he  just seems to be a reasonable person ”  he  said. “I have more sympathy to some leaders because I feel I share something with them. I do like  him  more.  His  wife is very beautiful and a sophisticated woman as well.”,Positive,1,Positive
4195,818,Positive,The #AltRight backs  Assad .,Positive,1,Positive
4196,818,Positive, Spencer  said  he ’d been “aware” of  Assad  since the early 2000s. Coverage of  Assad  at the time  soon after  he ’d inherited the presidency from  his  father  was limited to a rigged referendum confirming  his  succession ( he  was the only candidate) and muted support for an opening up of the tightly controlled state.,Positive,1,Positive
4197,818,Positive,The core of it for  Spencer  was that  Assad   in addition to being the “rightful  legitimate ruler of Syria ” was fighting ISIS. Harking back to the question of  his  support for an Islamic leader   Spencer  stated: “The question really isn’t do I support white people or  Assad   the question really is whether I support  Assad  or ISIS?” But the alt-right narrative was complicated by the 2017 chemical attack on Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib province  which Trump responded to by launching a series of airstrikes into Syria — the first time the US had targeted the regime in all its years of smaller-scale involvement. The strikes provoked a split in prominent alt-right media figures  between those who continued to support Trump and those who officially declared themselves “OFF the Trump train ” in the case of British citizen Paul Joseph Watson. (He would later recant and rejoin the train.),Positive,1,Positive
4198,818,Positive,Those in the alt-right who supported  Assad  prior to supporting Trump came to see the US president’s strikes as explicit evidence of the deep state’s interference in Syria  with Mike Cernovich  at the time a leading alt-right personality  leading the charge by amplifying the #SyriaHoax false flag — laying the blame squarely at the feet of the “deep state.” As  Spencer  put it: “The fact that I  and most all of the alt-right  offer  him  moral support is because [TGT][TGT]  has become a bogeyman in the mainstream media and is clearly the target of the Deep State  military industrial complex  foreign-policy establishment.” “Sure  there might be some kids out there who want to shock their parents with an  Assad  meme  or something like that ”  he  admitted  putting those individuals on one end of a “spectrum” of support for the Syrian leader. Many of those in the alt-right  who support  Assad   are situated somewhere in the middle of reactionary trolling and deep state theories  according to  Spencer . “There are a lot of people who are so skeptical of everything that Washington does that whenever  Assad  is in the crosshairs they don’t like it  even if they don’t quite understand the full complexity of the issue.”  He  continued: “But I imagine that  on the whole  most in the alt-right share my perspective.” The engagement of a mostly younger  internet-literate crowd — like Tsang — rests on an bedrock of older and more traditional right-wing and far-right support for the Syrian president. David Duke  former imperial wizard of the Ku Klux Klan  has voiced his support for  Assad   as has Ann Coulter. Across the Atlantic  France’s Marine Le Pen has stated that  Assad  is the the “solution” to the region’s current turmoil  and in the UK  Nigel Farage has voiced tepid support for the continuation of the  Assad  regime  as has controversial columnist Katie Hopkins  British Infowars writer Watson  and British Nationalist Party founder Tommy Robinson. But Cernovich wants everyone to ignore the memes  the support at Charlottesville  the discussions online — and his once-upon-a-time advocacy for  Assad . As Cernovich attempts to join the mainstream   he  is pivoting away from some tenets — such as support for  Assad  — and  despite evidence to the contrary  arguing that such support does not exist. Despite that  he  does think the Syrian leader should remain in place: “Opposing regime change  in my view  isn’t supporting anyone.” “Zero Trump supporters back  Assad   this is the definition of fake news ”  he  said. “I've talked to thousands of Trump supporters  never heard of  Assad  support.” ●,Positive,1,Positive

4551,870,Positive,But Gaga has spent the past three years deconstructing her previous project  which is its own kind of performance. Elaborate dance pop ceded ground to jazz standards  showtunes  and country rock. Tentacle gowns went into the closet; jeans and a pink cowboy hat came out. The director Chris Moukarbel shot Five Foot Two largely on handheld—maybe even smartphone—cameras. You see Gaga cooking  recording  planning  crying  bonding. In one scene  she’s topless as she chats with her team by the poolside. The implication: This is Gaga  au naturel. Yet she never seems to forget the camera. Five Foot Two documents last year’s release of [TGT]and makes clear how much Gaga’s public reboot relied on demonstrating that she  like everyone else  suffers. Gaga has increasingly mined the traumas of her own life  with songs and philanthropic efforts growing out of her rape at age 19. The dissolution of her engagement to the actor Taylor Kinney  mournfully referenced a few times in the documentary  seemed to inform the breakup-themed Joanne singles “Perfect Illusion” and “Million Reasons.” But there was a deeper source of anguish on  [TGT]. [TGT] is named for  [TGT]  aunt  an aspiring artist who died of lupus at age 19 in 1974. “Seeing what that did to [my father] and my family was the most powerful thing I experienced growing up ” Gaga tells the journalist Darryl Pinckney in the film. “I am Joanne. I am my father’s daughter. That is what this record is about.”,Positive,1,Positive
4552,870,Positive,The most memorable scene of the documentary comes when she first plays the album’s delicate  acoustic title track for her grandmother   Joanne’s  mom. The moment verges on uncomfortable  and not only because Gaga’s father   Joanne’s  brother  gets up and leaves the room in apparent distress midway through. Gaga herself seems hungry to have her telling of an ordeal she did not personally experience validated by those who did. “Did I get it right?” she asks her grandmother  mid-hug. “Yes you did ” her grandmother responds. But she has a warning for Gaga  too: “Don’t become maudlin over all this.” For now  Gaga is asking not for applause but understanding. It’s never explicitly stated  but Gaga seems to connect to  Joanne ’s story in part because of  her  own medical situation. Iconography about hospitals and crutches and wheelchairs over the years hinted that the seemingly bionic pop star faced problems of the flesh off-stage. In 2010   she  told Larry King  she  tested “borderline positive” for lupus.  She ’s still feeling the effects of the injury  she  sustained in 2013  as seen in a Five Foot Two moment when  she  pauses rehearsals for  her  Super Bowl halftime show because of hip tightness.  Fibromyalgia  appears to make that problem worse  and being a pop star in chronic pain certainly doesn’t seem easy. One scene shows  her  having  her  makeup done for a performance while sitting in a doctor’s examination room.,Positive,1,Positive
4553,870,Positive,Gaga’s particular ailment is an almost-literal rendering of Jamison’s “pain without a cause”—which is  as  she  notes  “pain which can’t be trusted.” A poorly understood but widespread disorder that seems to inordinately affect women  fibromyalgia is sometimes assumed to be psychosomatic. “Drug Approved. Is Disease Real?” read a 2008 New York Times headline about the first FDA-sanctioned drug to treat it. Gaga has said that she wants to help raise awareness and research dollars. During one excruciating flare-up shown in Five Foot Two  she sympathizes with less-privileged sufferers of the disorder: “Like  I don’t know what I’d fuckin’ do if I didn’t have everybody here to help me.” A few moments later  she’s looking straight into the camera. “Do I look pathetic?” she asks  tear-streaked  lying on a couch  a therapist massaging her. “I’m so embarrassed.” It’s a powerful moment because the stigma of pain is clearly part of the pain itself. But it’s also aesthetically striking. To answer Gaga’s question  she actually looks like she did in parts of the “Bad Romance” video—crying  stripped down  and oddly luminous. It’s a sign of fame’s power on the viewer: Whatever lengths she might go to put person over persona  the persona remains. * * * Pop music has firmly moved on from the phase of gleeful  Technicolor artifice that Gaga stood for at her peak. Contemporaries in wildness like Kesha and Miley Cyrus have done much what Gaga has done and traded Alexander McQueen creations for cowboy boots. They have also made a diaristic turn  harmonizing their music with their angsty  tabloid sagas.,Positive,1,Positive
4554,870,Positive,Usually this means trading on the spectacle of suffering to sell pop’s ultimate commodity—inspiration. Beyoncé’s Lemonade is the signal example  taking the sting of infidelity to spin a tale of hurt and overcoming. Kesha’s alleged abuse by her mentor and producer Dr. Luke was addressed and transcended on this year’s Rainbow. Katy Perry marketed her latest album with an on-camera therapy session in which she cried about her “real” self wanting to be known. Taylor Swift seems on the verge of unveiling a more acidic survival story. “Victim to victory” songs are always in fashion  but the latest boom relies  more than pop usually does  on the feeling of authenticity. Adult listeners of drive-time radio typically know they’re in the realm of fantasy and commerce  yet fully enjoying the confessional-pop performance means buying into the non-musical narratives surrounding them. Beyoncé rolled her own child and husband into the Lemonade visual experience. “I write this shit  baby ” Kesha insisted on a recent single. You’re explicitly asked to believe that the gap between performer and person is negligible.  [TGT]already fit into this triumphant-confessional class  with Gaga singing about family members and friends by name and roaring  “I might not be flawless but you know I’ve got a diamond heart.” The meta-text  all along  was Gaga’s own career arc—a sense that  [TGT] ’d come down from the heights  [TGT] ’d reached from 2008 to 2013  stumbled with  [TGT]  third album  and might never recover. Glimmers of past traumas and family tragedy contributed to the pathos.  [TGT]  medical troubles would seem to retroactively add in a new layer  though it’s unclear when  [TGT]  received  [TGT]  fibromyalgia diagnosis  and little on the album can be heard as an explicit reference to illness. Certainly the lyrics about healing through love on  [TGT]  post- [TGT]single  “The Cure ” now seem a lot less generic.,Positive,1,Positive

4754,906,Positive,The clues are out there  if you know where to look. Scattered across far-flung corners of the internet  there is evidence that  Zulfi Hoxha  the son of an Albanian-American pizza-shop owner from New Jersey   had sinister plans. First there’s the defunct Twitter profile  which at one point engaged in a conversation with a State Department counter-propaganda account about the Islamic State. Then there’s the fact that  he  used the social-networking site Paltalk  a communications platform reportedly popular among Western jihadis. But none of it compares to the ISIS propaganda video that  according to multiple law-enforcement officials  shows  Hoxha  beheading captured Kurdish soldiers. If they are right about his identity   Hoxha  is the first American Islamic State member known to be beheading individuals in such a video.  Hoxha  is now known to have become a senior commander of Islamic State and one of the faces of the group’s recruitment efforts  according to federal court records.  Hoxha  left the United States on April 6  2015. Four days later   he  was in an Islamic State training camp. Within just six months  according to multiple law-enforcement officials   he  was featured in that gruesome video. Related Story The American Climbing the Ranks of ISIS As cases of Islamic State supporters continue to trickle through the American justice system  details are slowly emerging of both the extent of American involvement in the upper echelons of the group and the role of recruitment and mobilization networks in the country. Investigations have already uncovered the stories of Americans like John Georgelas and Abdullah Ramo Pazara  both of whom were part of wider jihadi networks in America and eventually reached relatively high-ranking and influential positions within the Islamic State hierarchy. While the ISIS presence in America is often characterized by so-called “lone wolves ” attackers who claim allegiance to the Islamic State but show little formal connections either to its operatives overseas or other likeminded Americans  stories like that of Zulfi Hoxha are a reminder of the existence and importance of jihadist recruitment networks in the United States. The extent of these networks does not compare to those in Europe  but they nonetheless play a crucial role in recruiting and mobilizing American foreign fighters for ISIS  who number in the dozens. Indeed  the majority of American foreign fighters we have identified had close connections to other American supporters of ISIS prior to their departure. Some  like Hoxha  made these connections through the internet and  via their new contacts  were able to liaise with ISIS facilitators who helped them travel to Syria.,Positive,1,Positive
4755,906,Positive,As the physical caliphate quickly disappears  media reports speak of foreign fighters  including Americans  attempting to lay low in Turkey before deciding their next move. Others have returned to their home countries  much to the concern of law-enforcement officials who sometimes lack the personnel and legal tools to address the issue. However  for the time being  the once-feared “wave” of returning Western foreign fighters has only amounted to a trickle. Yet even from afar  Western ISIS recruits wield influence on their sympathizers back home. * * * In May 2017  the Islamic State media office in Iraq’s Nineveh province released a 45-minute video entitled “We Will Surely Guide Them To Our Ways.” Like many Islamic State media productions  the video includes cameos of foreign fighters from several countries. One of the masked men depicted in the video is an American going by the name of “Abu Hamza al-Amriki.” Speaking in an inflected American accent  he criticizes the United States-led efforts against Islamic State and exhorts the “muwahiddin [believers]” in America to carry out domestic attacks: “Are you incapable of stabbing a kaffir [non-Muslim] with a knife  throwing him off of a building  or running him over with a car? Liberate yourself from hellfire by killing a kaffir.” Later  he shows off American-made rocket launchers  reportedly taken from Shia and Kurdish militias after Islamic State defeated them on the battlefield. During a two-year investigation on the cadre of Americans who successfully travelled to Syria and Iraq to join the group  federal records revealed that Abu Hamza al-Amriki is Zulfi Hoxha.,Positive,1,Positive
4756,906,Positive,By the time of the video’s release  the U.S. Department of Justice was already knee-deep in the prosecution of several domestic Islamic State supporters who allegedly assisted Hoxha in his travel to join the group. One of these individuals  David “Daoud” Wright  was sentenced in December 2017 to 28 years in federal prison  after being convicted of providing material support to Islamic State and conspiring to murder U.S. citizens. As a result of evidence introduced at Wright’s trial  a number of details about  Hoxha    his  connections to Wright and  his  co-conspirators  and  his  role in Islamic State quietly became available. At the time of the video’s filming   Hoxha  was around 25 years old. Records of  his  travel from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection  filed as court exhibits  show  Hoxha  departing the United States for Istanbul  Turkey on April 6  2015.  He  arrived in Islamic State-held territory in Syria shortly thereafter. According to its sentencing memorandum in the Wright case  U.S. law enforcement now assesses that  Hoxha  “has become an ISIS senior commander ” but the filing provides no further details as to his role or current whereabouts. However  the May 2017 video puts him in northwestern Iraq. This is so far the only instance in which the U.S. government has confirmed the name (and American citizenship) of an Islamic State member who appears in one of the group’s media products. While a number of Americans have appeared in terrorist propaganda videos over the years  law enforcement rarely comments on their identity. Moreover  the government does not often publicly release its assessments of American Islamic State members’ role or rank.  [TGT] ’s apparent status in the group places  [TGT]  in an elite category of the group’s American members who have risen to some level of leadership. Most American Islamic State supporters never made it to Syria. In the last three years  more than 50 were arrested attempting to the make the journey. Still others were charged for activities ranging from raising money for the group to planning attacks.,Positive,1,Positive
4757,906,Positive,Following the Wright trial  we made repeated attempts to gain more information on  Hoxha  from official channels. A representative from the U.S. Attorney’s office in Massachusetts declined to comment  as did the FBI’s national office. Matthew Reilly  spokesman for the New Jersey U.S. Attorney’s Office stated  “no defendant by that name has been charged in the District of New Jersey.” Unofficially  intelligence sources confirmed a rumor we had quietly chased for months. In October 2015  a video was released by the Islamic State of a purported American brutally beheading a Kurdish peshmerga soldier. The 15-minute video  shot from multiple camera angles  features four individuals dressed in black and standing behind captured Kurdish soldiers. Its subject speaks with the same accent and inflection as  Hoxha  in the May 2017 release. Multiple law-enforcement officials told us that the individual who says he is “delivering a message to Obama” and then commits the first execution is  Hoxha . If officially confirmed  it would be the first case of an American Islamic State member beheading someone in a propaganda video. * * * Little is known about  Hoxha ’s personal background. A search for  his  online activity finds a defunct Twitter account bearing  his  name  which interacted with other Islamic State supporters  as well as detractors. In October 2014  for example  the account engaged in conversation with the State Department’s “Think Again Turn Away” account  which at the time was trying to counter Islamic State messaging on the platform. He was actually not the first American jihadi to do so. Around the same time  a 17-year-old  Ali Amin  was also trolling the State Department Twitter account. A short time later  he was arrested and ultimately sentenced to 11 years for encouraging his high school friend to join the Islamic State.,Positive,1,Positive
4758,906,Positive, Hoxha ’s presence elsewhere online also reveals links to how  he  connected with  his  future co-conspirators. An account on the gaming website Steam bearing the username “Hohxa77” lists  his  favorite titles  including Splinter Cell  Mortal Kombat  and Left 4 Dead. Indeed  this shared interest in video games may have been one of the first things that brought  Hoxha  together with David Wright  who was listed as a friend on  his  Steam account under the name “d.sharifwright.” During Wright’s trial  prosecutors argued that he used several video games  including Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare and other titles to “virtually prepare” for jihad. His defense attorneys  however  painted Wright  who weighed over 400 pounds at the time of the conspiracy  as a “fat  failed loser” who used video games as a substitute for real-life violent activity  according to the trial transcript. Unfortunately  one can be both a gamer who veers towards violence and weigh in at 400 pounds of loneliness and isolation. Islamic State’s 2015 instructional manual for its Western supporters  “How to Survive in the West ” includes references to video games as a method of training to join the group. More importantly  it may have brought together Wright and Hoxha  who unlike Wright successfully followed through on his intentions to support the Islamic State using violence. At the trial  investigators claimed that Wright and  Hoxha ’s conspiracy began in November 2014  although the two may have virtually met one another as early as 2010. The two most revealing elements of Wright and  Hoxha ’s online interactions are their use of Skype and the social-networking site Paltalk. According to court records  at the time  Wright (under the alias Umar Mukhtar Abdul-Qadir) and  Hoxha  were both members of chatrooms on Paltalk called “The Solution for Humanity” and “Road to Jannah.”,Positive,1,Positive
4759,906,Positive,During Wright’s interrogation  which was recounted at trial in testimony by a local police officer  he claimed that  Hoxha  reached out to him via Paltalk and asked him if he was interested in Islamic State. Wright told the officer that he responded three weeks later after conducting research  telling  Hoxha  that  he  believed that Islamic State’s’ mission was legitimate and necessary. From this point on  Hoxha and Wright were in frequent contact via Paltalk and Skype’s instant messenger service  sharing videos  issues of Islamic State’s official magazine Dabiq  and news articles about the group and its activities. These conversations between Wright and  Hoxha  continued until April 2015  when  Hoxha  left the U.S. to join Islamic State. Among the subjects of most interest were the best options for joining and what would ensure the maximum religious reward. Some early Western travelers believed that they could migrate to Islamic State-held territory (an act that the group refers to as hijrah)  but only participate in the societal aspects of the self-declared Caliphate while avoiding combat and violence. Neither Wright nor  Hoxha  appear to have held that naïve delusion. According to trial exhibits of their conversations  Wright cautioned  Hoxha  that “if you want to travel and live under a dawla [Islamic state] there is no harm in that  but you won’t receive the reward from Allah like those who are assembled in the ranks unless you assemble in the ranks.”,Positive,1,Positive
4760,906,Positive, Hoxha  and Wright’s respective commitments to violence are demonstrated elsewhere in their conversations  which were introduced into the trial exhibits. The two men sent each other links to Islamic State propaganda material  including the February 2015 video that depicted the burning of Jordanian pilot Muath al-Kasasbeh. They also exchanged information about how to buy guns online. As with most known cases of Americans travelling to join Islamic State  the internet proved a useful tool for  Hoxha . While it is often tempting to assume that individuals are “radicalized online” through their consumption of propaganda  this is rarely the case. More commonly  the internet allows people to make contacts with and plug themselves into pre-existing  real-world recruitment and radicalization networks. In  Hoxha ’s case  the network  he  found would encourage and eventually facilitate  his  travel to Islamic State territory. The court records show that prior to  Hoxha ’s departure  David Wright put  him  in touch with another American Islamic State supporter  his uncle Usaamah Rahim  and together they began helping  Hoxha  as  he  prepared to travel in the spring of 2015. The two men raised money for  Hoxha ’s plane ticket to Istanbul by selling Rahim’s laptop on Craigslist.  Hoxha  departed for Istanbul on April 6. A day earlier  Rahim contacted Wright on Skype with instructions from  Hoxha . “AsSalaamu A'laikum Zulfi asked me if you could delete his name off Skype ” Rahim writes. “But before you do it  if you have any saved messages to him go to ‘tools ’ go to ‘options ’ then click on ‘privacy ’ and click ‘clear history.’” These steps removed the interactions between  Hoxha  and Wright on Skype  but did not clear the metadata that would later be used in Wright’s trial.,Positive,1,Positive
4761,906,Positive,Throughout his journey  trial exhibits show   Hoxha  remained in contact with Rahim via various encrypted messengers  confirming his arrival at a safe house and then dropping out of contact after saying he was leaving for training. Thereafter  Rahim kept tabs on  Hoxha ’s activity via another Islamic State member who he contacted on encrypted messengers: the influential British Islamic State facilitator and virtual attack planner Junaid Hussain. In later conversations between Hussain and Rahim  Hussain comments on  Hoxha ’s location and whereabouts  saying that  he  was “in training” at an Islamic State camp. This indicates that Hussain may have helped  Hoxha  cross into the group’s territory. Wright  Rahim and a third member of the group  Nicholas Rovinski  eventually decided on a different path than that taken by  Hoxha . They were in the early stages of a plot to kidnap and behead the anti-Islam activist Pamela Geller when  on June 2  2015  Rahim was stopped by police outside of CVS in Roslindale  Massachusetts. They wanted to question him after wiretapping a conversation between Rahim and Wright that morning during which they discussed attack plans. Refusing to co-operate  Rahim pulled a hunting knife on the officers and was shot dead. Wright and Rovinski were arrested shortly afterward and charged with a range of offences; in 2016 Rovinski pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges related to the plot .

4867,925,Positive,"So  that's the calculus here. The deal is clearly dilutive to DIS shareholders in the short-term. Disney's press release included management's forecast that the purchase of  Fox  assets will be ""accretive to earnings before the impact of purchase accounting for the second fiscal year after the close of the transaction.""",Positive,1,Positive
4868,925,Positive,"When there are that many weasel words in a guidance paragraph  an analyst knows that management is not confident on the financials of the acquired company. Also  Disney's projection of ""at least $2 billion"" in cost savings from  the Fox deal  tellingly does not include a time-frame. I think that's a stretch. If anything  I believe Disney will likely end up spending incremental dollars  not saving them  to try and grow the Sky and Star India businesses that were languishing in the Fox corporate family.",Positive,1,Positive
4869,925,Positive,Obviously  though  for Disney  this deal  is about assets  not earnings per share. Currently there are five major studios globally  with Lionsgate and Paramount occupying what I would classify as strong second-tier positions. After  this deal   obviously  there will only be four first-time filed entertainment providers  and Warner Brothers Universal and Sony/Columbia will have to deal with an Evil Empire that will eventually control its own version of a Death Star  a direct-to-consumer network.,Positive,1,Positive
4870,925,Positive,So  Netflix's dominance is challenged  and I believe that Netflix is the big loser in  the Disney-Fox deal . At 17.2x analyst consensus for 2018 EPS  Disney shares are not particularly expensive. Finally clinching  the Fox deal  (actual closure is expected by June 30th  2018) will allow Disney management to shift shareholder focus from the sinking ship that is ESPN to the high-quality stable of filmed entertainment properties that are controlled by the combined entity. Content is still king.,Positive,1,Positive

That means that  sometime early next week   [TGT]will pass Furious 7 ($353m in 2015) to become Dwayne Johnson’s biggest domestic grosser of all time.

4924,934,Positive,In the end  whether it was by design or not  Brian Cashman’s choice for the next manager of the Yankees had come down to two huge risks — Aaron Boone  who had absolutely no experience as a manager or coach  or Hensley Meulens  whose only managerial experience had been as a largely ceremonial skipper of the Netherlands in the World Baseball Classic.,Neutral,0,Neutral
4925,934,Positive,From the get-go  Boone made it clear he was serious about wanting to manage; that this wasn’t just whimsy on his part  and once given his audience with  Cashman  and his baseball people  did a bang-up job of selling himself.,Positive,1,Positive
4926,934,Positive,After practicing his repelling from the Landmark Building in Stamford  Conn.  for the annual Lights and Heights Christmas event Sunday   Cashman  said Friday  he  had closed the doors on further interviews and was ready to make  his  recommendation to Yankees general partner Hal Steinbrenner from among Boone  Meulens  Carlos Beltran  Eric Wedge  Rob Thomson or Chris Woodward for the successor to Joe Girardi. In truth  he had already made up his mind it was Boone and once word leaked out of San Francisco early Friday night that Meulens was staying with the Giants  it was pretty much official.,Positive,1,Positive
4927,934,Positive,Based on sourced information from how all the interviews went down  Boone  Meulens and Beltran all made the strongest impressions on  Cashman  and  his  team of close advisors that included VP of Baseball Operations Tim Naehring  assistant GM Mike Fishman  and Senior VP Jean Afterman. Just the same  you had to immediately eliminate Beltran  if only because there was no way  Cashman  was going to take THAT big of a risk  turning the managerial reins over to someone fresh out of the player ranks. Of course  no one knows either if Boone or Meulens have any idea of how to handle a pitching staff  which is why  in retrospect   Cashman  made sure to retain the services of Larry Rothschild  recognized as one of the best pitching coaches in the business.,Neutral,0,Neutral
4928,934,Positive,Boone — Checked the three most important boxes with Cashman: A willingness to embrace analytics  communication skills with the players  and experience with handling the New York media. All of that made him an instant popular choice  but it didn’t hurt that he also came from a three generational major league family  in which his father  Bob  managed the Royals and the Reds.  Cashman  fancies  himself  as an “out-of-the-box” thinker and this was the ultimate bold “out-of-the-box” choice.,Neutral,0,Neutral
4929,934,Positive,Beltran — Impressed  Cashman  and  his  staff with the sheer force of  his  personality and knowledge of the game. If [TGT][TGT]  hadn’t just retired and had spent perhaps just one year as a coach or minor league manager   [TGT]  might have been the favorite. As it is   [TGT]  will be with the Yankees in some capacity next year  either as a bench or hitting coach for Boone or a special assistant to [TGT] . Whatever  [TGT]  wants to do.,Positive,1,Positive
4930,934,Positive,Eric Wedge — The only candidate with major league managing experience   Cashman  only interviewed  him  because other GMs  former and present  gave  him  high grades. But there was no way  Cashman  was going to go to Steinbrenner with a recommendation of a manager who had failed in two other places  Seattle and Cleveland  with seven losing seasons in 10 years. In addition   his  bland personality would have never gone over in New York.,Positive,1,Positive
4931,934,Positive,Rob Thomson —  He  was only in the process out of loyalty to the Yankee organization — 28 years in various capacities  most importantly spring training coordinator the past few seasons. Ordinarily going from bench coach to manager would have been a natural ascension. The fact that it wasn’t — and Thomson was again thrown into the mix of candidates — told you he was never a serious candidate for the job. He now leaves the Yankees to go to the Phillies as their bench coach.,Positive,1,Positive
4932,934,Positive,Chris Woodward — It’s not quite clear as to why the Dodger third base coach was one of the candidates other than perhaps  Cashman  wanted to talk to someone who was part of Dave Roberts’ staff in Los Angeles. Early on   he  had talked about wanting a “Dave Roberts-type ” someone who was into the analytics and had good communication skills  especially with young players. Whatever  it doesn’t appear as if Woodward  the former light-hitting utility infielder who spent a couple of seasons with the Mets and had never before interviewed for a manager’s job  knocked anyone’s socks off.,Positive,1,Positive

5134,963,Positive,The similarities between Joe Kennedy III and Donald Trump are  in a sense  obvious. Both are white men  northeasterners  teetotalers. They are products of the Ivy League and great wealth. They joined their respective family trades – real estate for Trump  politics for Joe III.,Neutral,0,Neutral
5135,963,Positive,The differences are obvious too  and more illuminating. Joe III is a liberal avatar of American institutions: the Kennedy family  Stanford  Harvard Law. Self-effacing in person  he recognizes how easy his path has been – he only briefly served as an assistant DA before taking a House seat -- and had  until now  chosen to mitigate charges of nepotism by playing the part of diligent backbencher. The Kennedys  for all their famous faults  have the saving grace that comes from being in on the joke; when President Kennedy appointed his younger brother attorney general  he quipped that he was just trying to give Bobby some experience before he started practicing law.,Positive,1,Positive
5136,963,Positive,"The result is the great destabilization of the Trump era. Few  it seems  have a firm grasp on what is happening  let alone what might happen next. Everybody  regardless of their ideology  thinks they're losing. A realignment appears to be happening in our politics  but nobody can agree on what it looks like. ""We all feel the fault lines of a fractured country "" as  [TGT]put it in  [TGT]  stilted  awkward speech on Tuesday night.",Positive,1,Positive
5137,963,Positive,There is  of course  an element of nostalgia in liberalism's newfound fondness for our institutions. Trump-era liberalism  with its emphasis on American global leadership and veneration of federal agencies and the mainstream press  would be easily recognizable to that first generation of Kennedys. And in that sense  it makes sense that  [TGT]would become a natural face of contemporary Democratic politics.,Positive,1,Positive
5138,963,Positive,Tuesday night was an attempt to make  Joe III  a symbol of institutional resistance to Trump. To the question of whether the institutions are worth saving  and therefore capable of reform   [TGT] answer is an enthusiastic yes.  [TGT]  is  in a sense  already a symbol of how  [TGT]  own family has repaired itself from its reckless  impulsive  and selfish ways;  [TGT]  seems serious   [TGT]  is sober. The message  [TGT]  sends is that  [TGT]  family   [TGT]  party  and all the other institutions that nurtured  [TGT]  still have an innate and positive utility  an essential role to play. Where Trump says the rot must be amputated   [TGT]promises that a strong dose of antibiotics is all that's needed.,Positive,1,Positive
5139,963,Positive,Whether this message resonates among the Democratic rank-and-file is another story. While the liberal commentariat   Joe III's  natural constituency  remains fixated on norms and the need to defend institutions  a newly ascendant left sees civility as a neoliberal plot to uphold the status quo.

5174,967,Neutral,The governor’s fight against opioid abuse won him national praise. But the standing ovation really should go to the Christie who pushed for drug courts  treatment over incarceration and the near elimination of cash bail. No other governor could have done so much to right the scales of justice for minorities and low-income defendants. None of this is sexy to voters in national primaries  which makes these initiatives so much more important in judging all that was  Christie . He was capable of being a great leader.,Neutral,0,Neutral
5175,967,Neutral,Then came Superstorm Sandy— the event that made  Christie  a national figure even as it pretty much set in motion everything that destroyed him. It fed his ego. The national attention he received in his blue fleece telling someone to get off the beach  the bombast that was akin to a happy King Lear  not howling at the wind  but pushing the wind back. He seemed invincible.,Neutral,0,Neutral
5176,967,Neutral,After Sandy  Christie was a rising Republican star. Everything he did was now seen through a rosy prism. He was the Republican governor of a blue state getting things done. To be clear: New Jersey is neither blue nor red. It’s madras. Tom Kean  Christie Whitman — Republicans had won statewide before. New Jersey wanted a reformer in 2009 and  Christie  seemed to fit that bill.,Neutral,0,Neutral
5177,967,Neutral,The most telling moment from  Christie’s  final State of the State address this month was a sentence he ad-libbed. The prepared text read: “We ran to be a Governor who did not just mark time. We ran to win and to be a Governor of consequence.” What  Christie  said during the speech was  “I ran to win. I always ran to win. I ran to be a governor of consequence.”,Neutral,0,Neutral
5178,967,Neutral,That’s it in a nutshell. The fatal flaw. A chief executive consumed with winning who would assemble a team consumed with his winning. It explains more than anything how Bridgegate could come to pass  how a smart  politically savvy man like  Christie  could put so many of the wrong people in high-profile jobs. Did he know before the George Washington Bridge lane closures  during the lane closures or shortly after the lane closures that created a massive four-day traffic jam? At this point it matters less than that he always knew too many people on his team were capable of being punitive  petty and destructive in the cause of  Christie  winning.,Neutral,0,Neutral
5179,967,Neutral, Christie  tried to minimize the scandal.  He  wasted millions of taxpayer dollars on a whitewash report prepared by high-priced lawyers.  He  bled NJ Transit dry.,Positive,1,Positive
5180,967,Neutral, He  bullied.  He  baited. And just as Sandy had made  him  a star  Bridgegate made  him  a pariah. Not all at once. But by the time  he  left New Jersey to raise money for Republican governors across the nation and then to openly pursue the presidency   he  was already failing in New Jersey.,Neutral,0,Neutral
5181,967,Neutral,I once was as close to a Christie cheerleader as  he  could find in the New Jersey media. There was a time when I believed  he  was the real deal.  He  was funny  well informed and enjoyed a vigorous debate on issues — at least off the record.,Neutral,0,Neutral
5182,967,Neutral,The brilliance of  Christie  remains somewhere inside him  but he was not the greatest natural politician I will ever see. The greatest natural politician would never forget that he was entirely dependent on the charity of others — voters.  Christie  once told a young man at a town hall who asked how to get into politics that you first have to ask people for their votes. He said a candidate had to recognize that voters could choose anyone they wanted  that receiving a vote was a gift.,Neutral,0,Neutral
5183,967,Neutral,The governor forgot that lesson or  as his ratings tanked  decided it no longer mattered. He became more important than anything. It was not about New Jersey winning  but  Christie  winning.,Neutral,0,Neutral

[TGT]is a well-respected judge  arrives at home to  [TGT]  husband Jack (Stanley Tucci) telling  [TGT]  that he would like to have an affair  and that Fiona  if  [TGT]  cares about him  will tolerate it. This leads to the film’s single flashback: as  she  lays awake at night   her  imagination reaches back to happier times and to a moment of pure joy when he surprised  her  with a new piano. Unlike in “On Chesil Beach”  the flashback here adds little to illuminate their predicament: the viewer is still left guessing as to how  she  ended up married to an American professor  or what their love was like at its peak.,Positive,1,Positive
5293,985,Positive,The marriage crisis exacerbates another one  this time in  Fiona ’s working life.  She  specialises in extraordinarily hard cases involving children  often with a religious element.  Her  newest case is an urgent one: Adam  a 17-year-old Jehovah’s Witness with leukaemia  is refusing a blood transfusion that could save his life.  Fiona  must decide his corporeal and perhaps spiritual fate.  She  has been able to dispassionately dispatch such cases in the past  but since  her  husband’s disruption of their marriage   her  confidence is faltering.,Positive,1,Positive
5294,985,Positive, Her  interest in the boy then  so steadfast in his own faith  is both professional and personal.  Fiona  takes the unusual step of visiting him in the hospital  and under Richard Eyre’s thoughtful direction  the camera offers extreme close-ups of both characters  allowing the audience to search their eyes for meaning.  Fiona  is looking for cracks in Adam’s guarded wall of faith. The viewer is looking for the real motive behind  hers .,Neutral,0,Neutral
5295,985,Positive,Unfortunately  it never quite appears.  Her  judicial ruling comes suddenly  ending its fascinating inquiry into the nature of faith and connection before it has even begun. Adam lives but becomes disillusioned with his faith and begins stalking Fiona  trading one obsession for another. Mr Eyre seems to be looking for some of the same notes that worked so well for him in “Notes of a Scandal” (2006)  but this is not a lurid tale  and efforts to make it one—with wistful glances and tense  longing strings on the soundtrack—seem out of place. For this conflict to have dramatic heft  the viewer needs to understand  Fiona  better.,Positive,1,Positive
5296,985,Positive,Perhaps a screenwriter with more distance from the original material would have been willing to radically reshape the novel  offering more backstory or drawing  her  decision out for dramatic impact to make the story less reliant on  her  inner life. “On Chesil Beach” did not call for such revisions  but “The Children Act” does. It shows that every adaptation is a unique case  even two self-adapted novels from the same hand. Some cannot simply be transposed onto the screen. Most of all  however  it shows that the writer who knows the material best is not always the one best placed to make the hard choices that can turn a great novel into a great film.,Positive,1,Positive

5305,986,Positive,Analysts said the North Korean leader’s speech on Monday showed more confidence compared to previous years  his old habit of swaying from side to side while making speeches nearly undetectable. In his first New Year’s address as North Korea’s leader in 2013   Kim  frequently sounded short of breath  his voice wavering from time to time.,Negative,-1,Negative
5306,986,Positive, Kim  made  his  maiden public address in April 15  2012 at a parade marking the centenary of  his  grandfather’s birth. This year  there was none of the uneasiness that marked that speech and  his  subsequent public addresses.,Positive,1,Positive
5307,986,Positive, His  voice   his  hair shaved on the side  as well as  his  light-colored Western-style suit and glasses  were also reminiscent of  his  grandfather  Kim Il Sung  according to defectors and analysts. Kim Il Sung had a more gregarious and popular image than  Kim Jong Un’s  reclusive father  Kim Jong Il.,Positive,1,Positive
5308,986,Positive, [TGT]has embraced New Year addresses as a chance to outline  [TGT]  policies and rally the North Korean people. Last year   [TGT]  used  [TGT]  speech to declare that North Korea was in the “final stages” of perfecting an intercontinental ballistic missile.,Neutral,0,Neutral

5312,987,Neutral,The more I hear about [TGT]'s “Charles Manson movie ” now titled Once Upon A Time In Hollywood  the more intriguing it sounds. The film is reportedly similar to Tarantino's beloved masterpiece  Pulp Fiction  and revolves around a fading actor (Leo DiCaprio) and his stunt double (Brad Pitt) in seventies Hollywood  struggling to adapt to the changing industry.,Neutral,0,Neutral
5313,987,Neutral,But the two also happen to live next door to real-life murder victim Sharon Tate  and it’s unclear how the film will handle this delicate subject matter -  Tarantino  isn’t exactly known for his sense of restraint.,Neutral,0,Neutral
5314,987,Neutral,Indeed   Tarantino  has to navigate some rough waters in order to make this inherently controversial concept a success  in the era of perpetual Twitter outrage. We live in a time where snarky entertainment writers like  myself  are always looking for the next controversy  be it real or imagined. For example  the groundbreaking Black Panther was recently criticized for a lack of LGBT representation  for some reason  and Netflix was accused of whitewashing for casting Jared Leto in the role of a western man entering the unfamiliar world of the Yakuza  in a film literally titled  “The Outsider.”,Positive,1,Positive
5315,987,Neutral,But  Tarantino ’s filmography has always attracted controversy.  His  scripts are peppered with more racial slurs than pop culture references  smatterings of misogynistic violence and a ton of historical revisionism. But Once Upon A Time In Hollywood practically seems to be begging for controversy -  he ’s not the first filmmaker to retell the gruesome tale of Sharon Tate  but releasing  his  film on the anniversary of her death is a bit … gratuitous  even for Tarantino.,Neutral,0,Neutral
5316,987,Neutral,But I have a strong suspicion that  Tarantino  is going to go down the “revenge fantasy” route for this one. When exploring the atrocities of history  the man gleefully paints over the facts  splashing the screen with the blood of slaveholders and Nazis. This (inevitably) angers some  but  Tarantino  isn’t exactly striving for historical accuracy.,Neutral,0,Neutral
5317,987,Neutral,Most of us are aware of the tragic realities of history  but you’re not always in the mood to watch The Pianist - most of us would rather watch Inglourious Basterds for the fifth time. Despite repeatedly targeting the most distasteful subject matter imaginable   Tarantino  has always understood exactly how far  he  can push  his  audience.,Positive,1,Positive
5318,987,Neutral,And that’s one of the most impressive qualities of  Tarantino ’s movies  in my opinion.  His  films might feature rape  torture  and exceedingly bloody murder  but you could happily watch one while snacking and never lose your appetite for a moment  because the violence never crosses a certain line;  his  bloodsoaked cinematic universe is closer to Looney Tunes than torture porn.,Positive,1,Positive
5319,987,Neutral,Tarantino's personal life  on the other hand  might be the biggest obstacle facing the film. The man was recently hit with a wave of much-deserved criticism  after Uma Thurman exposed his tyrannical  reckless behavior on the set of Kill Bill. The story does not paint  Tarantino  in a sympathetic light  and  his  long friendship with the predatory Harvey Weinstein doesn’t help.,Neutral,0,Neutral

She  and Moss began reading and dancing to  Shange ’s poems in New York cafes. The next thing  Shange  knew   she  was being whisked off by theatrical producer Woodie King Jr.  who told  her  what  she ’d really written was a play.

5489,1015,Negative,Is  it  just me  or is anybody else worried about [TGT] ?,Neutral,0,Neutral
5490,1015,Negative,Maybe  it ’s just the recency bias of a bad three-game trip to California in which the Blackhawks defense was exposed as if each unit has to take a turn looking awful in this season that refuses to end. Or maybe  [TGT]is the last of the core players to succumb this season to the fall of the dynasty. Or maybe it’s long-lasting and irretrievable.,Neutral,0,Neutral
5491,1015,Negative,The last possibility is the scary one because  [TGT]has always been the barometer of good Hawks and bad Hawks. The Hawks’ offense has always started with the defense  and the defense starts with  Keith   and unfortunately of late  the defense has been inept and inert  not to mention soft and slow.,Neutral,0,Neutral
5492,1015,Negative,In Sunday’s loss in Anaheim   [TGT]aided and abetted a power-play goal by Ducks forward Rickard Rakell by doing little to prevent it. In the previous game   [TGT]committed two awful giveaways that led to Kings goals. In the first game of the jaunt in  San Jose  [TGT]was on the ice for four goals against while skating five-on-five.

5494,1015,Negative,The raw numbers in those games show  [TGT]  has been on the ice for three goals for and 19 against at even-strength for a minus-16.

5497,1015,Negative,Last season   Keith ’s goal-for percentage at five-on-five was 56.48. The raw count was 61-47. So  yeah   Keith  misses Niklas Hjalmarsson. A lot. The whole team does.,Neutral,0,Neutral
5498,1015,Negative, Keith   then  has had to adapt to different partners while continuing to play a lot and play against the opponent’s top line. All of those are legit causes for  Keith ’s unseemly numbers.

5499,1015,Negative,The eye test – my eye test  anyway – sees a guy whose reactions can’t quite keep up with his instincts.  Keith  has played several lifetimes of hockey the past decade – a lot of regular-season minutes  then even more minutes in an astounding 126 playoff games  and  oh  two Olympics – so it would reasonable to expect that at 34 even the indefatigable one would lose a half-step. That half-step can keep a player from getting to a spot first  from breaking up plays  from getting a stick on an opponent  from taking away a puck and moving it up ice.,Neutral,0,Neutral
5500,1015,Negative, Keith ’s remarkable ability seemed to make  him  a one-man neutral-zone trap.  Keith  regularly broke up plays and controlled the puck to create a lot of offense — a lot of quick offense. The Hawks were playing on a lot of short fields.,Positive,1,Positive
5501,1015,Negative,Thing is  the Hawks still control the puck at even-strength more than you’d think a bad team would  but the forwards aren’t turning that into goals. That would help  Keith ’s numbers look respectable  and maybe that changes next season. Maybe the scorers start scoring next season. Maybe another long offseason will help. Same goes for improved ability and consistency from the rest of the Hawks’ young defense corps.,Positive,1,Positive
5502,1015,Negative,This isn’t to bury  Keith .  He  can still play  even if not at  his  former Norris Trophy level. So  perhaps the biggest thing that would help the Hawks regain their contending ways is if GM Stan Bowman could bring in a defenseman who makes  Keith  only the second-best on the roster.,Positive,1,Positive

5550,1022,Positive,* * * France isn’t the first killjoy to quit the smartphone party. In 2015  the Canadian artist Garnet Hertz invented a cheeky device called “Phonesafe ” a masochistic lockbox designed to incarcerate smartphones for a set period of time. Hertz meant Phonesafe as a provocation  but the same idea quickly became a product. Today  you can buy similar  but mass-produced  containers on Amazon  and multi-phone lockers have become a mainstay in corporate offices and schools around the world. A McDonald’s in Singapore has even installed a locker designed to promote “family togetherness” and face-to-face conversation. If you attend a Guns n’ Roses concert or a comedy performance by Dave Chappelle  ushers will require you to lock your device in a neoprene pouch and take it into the show in that state.  The phone-locking pouch  made by a San Francisco company called Yondr   has a wide opening at the short end for inserting a smartphone. A magnetic locking mechanism  similar to those on anti-theft tags in retail stores  engages to hold it closed. After the show  this clasp is swiped across a counter-magnet  which releases the lock.  Yondr  is a surefire way to cut down on bootleg YouTube videos. In Wired  Alice Gregory recently took a tough look at the device. Gregory recounts her experience at a Chris Rock performance  where audience members waiting in the lobby had to forgo smartphone usage. The affair reduced them to “a roomful of jonesing fiends ” as she puts it. Ultimately  Gregory connects  Yondr  to a thorny question about civil liberties: the right of the people to keep and bear smartphones.,Positive,1,Positive
5551,1022,Positive,It’s an ironic conclusion  because  Yondr  is sold as a tool to provide freedom  rather than to take it away. To “Be Here Now ” as the company’s tagline puts it. It’s a promise to deliver presence—a tricky calling  to say the least. Presence has a long history in religion and philosophy  from Buddhist practices to the metaphysics of the 20th-century philosopher Martin Heidegger. Today  presence is most common in the various mindfulness trends that have overtaken individual and corporate life  in Silicon Valley in particular—collectively the critic R. John Williams has called them “technê-zen.” Cutting through the history and the rhetoric  it’s productive to think about presence in terms of attention. You’re present where you focus your attention—and you only have so much attention to pay. In the case of Chris Rock  he wants attention directed toward him  live on stage. Rock’s show might involve awkward improvisation or new material that he doesn't want circulated online. Teachers are less concerned about copyright than comedians are  but they still demand attention. I have tested Yondr’s effects on mind-wandering in classroom experiments with Dan Smilek of the University of Waterloo Vision and Attention Lab. Our research is based in part on the assumption that instructors want students to focus on the course materials  and not on Instagram  Facebook  or other distractions.  [TGT]can be a remarkably effective tool for enforcing digital abstinence in these contexts  thanks primarily to  [TGT]  portability. Rather than locking away devices inside lockers  or even inside a disused Catholic tabernacle  as I have done in a performance piece   Yondr  buffers the anxiety of being isolated from your device.,Positive,1,Positive
5552,1022,Positive,Given that the mere presence of one’s smartphone can reduce cognitive capacity   [TGT]offers a way to surf between the waves of a device’s presence and absence. You can hold it  but you can’t use it. This might be an especially important balance in classroom situations  where students see a teacher’s “phone shoebox” as an unwelcome imposition of authority. * * * Needless to say   [TGT]is still an imposition. And controlling attention requires more than just locking a device in a binge-breaking neoprene pouch. Joelle Renstrom has reported the results of her own  Yondr  experiment in a class at Boston University  where she had her 30 students lock away their devices over the course of a semester. At first  37 percent of the students found the policy annoying  but by the end of the term that figure had dropped to 14 percent. Those are promising  if tentative  results  but Renstrom’s anecdotal comments about the experiment may be more instructive than the data she collected. Renstrom describes her students’ initial experience of Yondr as “akin to caging a pet  a clear denial of freedom.” Moreover  she observes that some students left their cases unlocked as a sign of rebellion  even though they didn’t remove the phones from them. Rather than becoming “active resistors to technology ” as the scholars Christine Satchell and Paul Dourish call people who choose to ignore their devices   Yondr  users are ultimately the victims of technological disenfranchisement. When implemented as a mandatory smartphone prophylactic   Yondr  becomes a means of control  not of choice  let alone of presence.,Positive,1,Positive
5553,1022,Positive,Such top-down tactics might be enforced easily at live performances  as one of my research assistants observed firsthand at a Chris Rock show in Niagara Falls. However  as a daily ritual for high-school students  all-or-nothing digital abstinence enforced by an authority figure seems destined to backfire  possibly leading to rejection—or even worse  a legal complaint. In an attempt to tackle this disciplinary problem  I have been offering workshops to schoolteachers that riff on and revise the design Yondr originated. In the workshops  I provide a kit that allows students to make their own digital abstinence case  but with an obnoxiously loud Velcro enclosure rather than a silent  magnetic clasp. This semipermeable design—the Resistor Case  I call it—is intended to promote self-regulation  not authoritarian control. The Velcro acts as a gateway to conscience: It provides just enough resistance and noise to make its owner think twice before opening it. Michael I. Norton  Daniel Mochon  and Dan Ariely coined the “IKEA effect” to name the increase in value people assign to self-made products. With the Resistor Case  I’m counting on a similar effect  that students who fist construct and then choose to make use of their DIY phone lockers might be more compelled to use them. Of course  the kit will only work if the teacher provides a context for it that includes a discussion of responsible smartphone use. (The kit provides a series of cards to prompt this conversation.),Positive,1,Positive

Blazkowicz  a meaty slice of World War II-era Americana wrapped in alternate-history supersoldier technology and laden down with ludicrous lead dispensers of every stripe.  [TGT]is arguably responsible for the existence of the first-person shooter genre  and  [TGT]  wears  [TGT]  legacy well.

5621,1030,Positive,On the gameplay front  things are much simpler. Gunplay is tight  focused  and as satisfying as any shooter on the market. If there is one thing [TGT] knows  it’s how to make a spectacle of [TGT] slaughter. Upgradeable weapons and leveling perks mean that Blazkowicz is both actively and passively tuned to your gameplay style  with consistent and satisfying results. It may not be as utterly glorious as 2016’s DOOM revival  but it’s certainly close.,Positive,1,Positive
5622,1030,Positive,Still  at the end of the day  Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus is fun while it lasts. That’s a target all too many games in the current “games as a service” (to the publisher  courtesy of your wallet) climate have managed to miss. What is there is enjoyable  hampered only by its brevity. I think  given another year or so to expand on the game’s epic premise  we would have had another genre-defining title on our hands.

5662,1037,Positive,The New England Patriots opened as the favorites in their upcoming Super Bowl matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles  but that doesn’t mean it will be easy for Coach Bill Belichick and Tom Brady to earn their sixth championship ring together. In fact  it could become very difficult if Eagles quarterback [TGT] can exploit a glaring weakness in this year’s Patriots team: a poor pass defense that is one of the worst of any Super Bowl team coached by Belichick in New England.,Positive,1,Positive
5663,1037,Positive,Perhaps this wouldn’t be as concerning if quarterback  [TGT]hadn’t just dismantled the Minnesota Vikings’ defense in the NFC championship game. The Vikings entered that game allowing a passer rating of 74.0 yet  Foles  was able to turn in a career performance  completing 26 passes for 352 yards and three touchdowns in the Eagles’ win (141.4 passer rating). Per  Elias  Foles  was also the first quarterback in NFL history with completions for more than 40 yards to three different receivers in one postseason game.,Positive,1,Positive
5664,1037,Positive,Most impressive was how  Foles  handled the Vikings’ pass rush  which was widely considered among the best in the NFL.  Foles  completed 7 of 10 attempts under pressure for 139 yards and two touchdowns on Sunday  producing a sparkling 152.1 passer rating out of a possible 158.3. That’s a remarkable turnaround considering  Foles  had a 23.8 passer rating under pressure during the regular season. Yes  that is as bad as it sounds: an incomplete pass produces a passer rating of 39.6.,Positive,1,Positive
5665,1037,Positive, Nick Foles  in 2017 Regular season vs. Vikings in NFC championship game No pressure 107.8 119.7 Plays under pressure 23.8 152.1,Positive,1,Positive
5666,1037,Positive, Foles  also extended the defense with deep throws  completing 4 of 6 passes traveling at least 20 yards in the air for 172 yards and two touchdowns.  He  was 2 for 15 on those throws leading up to the big win on Sunday  compiling 52 yards and no touchdowns while also throwing an interception.,Positive,1,Positive
5667,1037,Positive,So it all comes down to how good the Patriots defense is on Super Bowl Sunday. In wins this season  including the playoffs  the Patriots allow a passer rating of 83.2. That jumps to 130.6 in losses  lower than the passer rating  Foles  turned in the NFC championship game (141.1).,Positive,1,Positive
5668,1037,Positive,One more big game from  him  and we could be looking at a historic upset.,Positive,1,Positive

That episode is among the decisions under review by the Justice Department's inspector general  which is expected to complete its report soon.,Positive,1,Positive

But then a doctor takes  [TGT]  to a room and  [TGT]  sees  [TGT]  two 6-month-old little brothers dead on a gurney. And it seems very dark  but it's a situation that happens all the time  and really it's based on real characters  including those twins. I've seen pictures of the twins laying on the gurney  and it's the sad truth.,Neutral,0,Neutral

5838,1061,Positive,And there's one more story from the White House we want to focus on now. Earlier in the week  we learned that the president has asked the Pentagon to look into staging a military parade. It seems intended as a celebration of the military and a demonstration of military might. So we thought  who better to ask about this than the people who served in uniform and whose service is being honored? And where better to talk about this than in the Barbershop  because that's where we talk to interesting folks about what's in the news and what's on their mind? So joining us today is  [TGT] .  [TGT]  served for 16 years in the Army and the Army Reserves.  [TGT]  served in Kosovo  among other assignments. As  [TGT]  prepared to deploy for Operation Iraqi Freedom  though   [TGT]  was diagnosed with cancer.  [TGT]  was eventually discharged. And  [TGT]  now runs Final Salute Inc. That's an organization that helps homeless women veterans  as  [TGT]  once was.  [TGT] 's also the mother of a son serving in the Air Force and is the wife of a former Marine. Major  thank you so much for speaking with us.,Positive,1,Positive
5839,1061,Positive,PLENZLER: Yeah  I have concerns mostly around the intent and the impact of the event  plus the cost. I agree with  Jas  on that. And  you know  our national military culture  we have parades where we roll out the active duty when it's a victory parade. And the war in Afghanistan is still going on. And the war in Iraq and Syria is still going on. So  I mean  we're nowhere near the end of those two conflicts. And it may go on for some years now.,Positive,1,Positive
5840,1061,Positive,MARTIN: And what about that   Jas ? I mean  one of the things that was striking to me is that a number of the people talking about this  particularly some of the millennial era - millenniums  millennials  rather - who have been - who are very active on social media  and one of their arguments was that this kind of conjures up the image of authoritarian  you know  governments like  you know  North Korea. You know  obviously  North Korea  that these huge displays of might are kind of a signature - Venezuela  Russia. I'm going to ask you the same thing - what Sherman's point is. What if - what about something that says  I respect and appreciate you?,Positive,1,Positive
5841,1061,Positive,MARTIN: OK. Well  as we get closer  we'll call you back and see how you all feel then. That's Sherman Gillums Jr.  Marine veteran  chief strategy officer for American Veterans  AMVETS. Joe Plenzler  another Marine veteran  director of media for The American Legion. Jas Boothe  former veteran  founder of Final Salute. We want to emphasize they're all speaking for themselves. But thank you all so much for coming.

5842,1062,Positive,Some advertisers are removing their ads from  Sean Hannity 's Fox News show in response to  his  coverage of the sexual-misconduct allegations against Roy Moore  the Republican US Senate candidate in Alabama.,Negative,-1,Negative
5843,1062,Positive," [TGT]is facing heat after several brands pulled their ads from  [TGT]  show. A wave of advertisers announced they would pull spots from ""Hannity"" following  [TGT] 's interview on Friday with Roy Moore in which they discussed allegations that Moore engaged in sexual misconduct with a 14-year-old and pursued relationships with other teenagers when he was in his 30s. Some media observers have noted that Hannity directly asked about the allegations. But critics say Hannity went too easy on Moore — whom he supported in the Alabama Senate primary — saying he appeared to agree with a characterization of some of the conduct as ""consensual."" Amid the left-wing media watchdog Media Matters urging sponsors to pull ads  Keurig  Realtor.com  Eloquii  23andMe  Nature's Bounty  and E-Trade all announced over the weekend that they had no plans to advertise on Hannity's Fox News show. More recently  brands such as Mercedes-Benz have jumped on the bandwagon  even as others such as MyPillow remain unfazed. Brands distancing themselves from politically or otherwise sensitive issues is nothing new. Several big-name advertisers were conspicuously absent from Megyn Kelly's interview in June with Alex Jones  the right-wing provocateur and conspiracy-monger. Similarly  in April  BMW  Mitsubishi  Hyundai  and Lexus were among the brands that pulled their ads from ""The O'Reilly Factor"" amid a wave of sexual-harassment allegations against its host  Bill O'Reilly. There has also been increasing consumer backlash to brands taking positions. But these emotional reactions are unprecedented  according to Canvs  a company that measures viewers' qualitative responses to content. It looks at all the spoken words about shows across social media and maps viewers' reactions with a range of 42 emotions. ""Unlike most emotional conversations about TV  brands have been raised to the forefront of the discussion surrounding ' Hannity  '"" a Canvs analyst told Business Insider. ""These brand-driven viewer emotional reactions are really unprecedented when you look at any show on TV."" Still   Hannity  has seen  his  ratings jump since Fox News moved  him  to a different time slot last month.  He  was already one of the highest-rated personalities in cable news.  He  has also weathered previous boycott calls by Media Matters  partially by rallying  his  viewers and supporters  who started a #BoycottKeurig campaign over the weekend and shared videos of themselves destroying the coffee machines. On Monday  Realtor.com deleted an initial tweet about pulling the ads  and Keurig's CEO apologized for ""taking sides."" ""The action is key because that is what will have a financial effect on  Hannity 's show  not the messaging that companies use "" said Angelo Carusone  the president of Media Matters. Carusone added that he was surprised that Realtor.com made a statement at all  considering the company is owned by Fox News' chairman  Rupert Murdoch.

5911,1071,Positive, Sanders  unquestionably built  his  “political revolution” on the strength of  his  message  not the kind of calculated mechanics that laid the foundation for the Clinton operation in Brooklyn. Still  some backers said  the campaign also suffered from basic structural and tactical work that  the senator  not only came late to  but at points actively resisted.,Positive,1,Positive
5912,1071,Positive,The nuts-and-bolts planning for a  Sanders  campaign began in March 2015  shortly before  his  April 30 announcement. In 2014  the liberal radio host Bill Press had hosted  Sanders  at  his  Washington home to talk over the decision to run with Senate staffers  senior Democrats  and strategists  along with “wise guys and gals who pontificated a lot ” recalled Longabaugh. “Helpful for  Bernie  and [ his  wife] Jane to hear — but it was not planning.”,Neutral,0,Neutral
5913,1071,Positive,Less than four months into the race  in August 2015  senior advisers sat down with  Sanders  and  his  wife in Burlington to address the issue in blunt terms: If they wanted to compete  they needed a more serious operation — a campaign with proper infrastructure and a more robust travel schedule  even if it meant missing votes in the Senate  they told  him   according to a person briefed on the conversation at the time. In short  there were basic realities about running for president that would have to be accepted.,Positive,1,Positive
5914,1071,Positive,Even after the meeting  billed publicly by advisers as “phase two” of the campaign   Sanders  struggled with that adjustment.  He  had to be convinced that TV ads were not just effective but necessary  and that using a pollster did not mean putting a finger to the wind.  He  never hired a political director.  He  didn't see the need for middle management. Basic functions like a regional press operation weren't fully in place until the primaries had started. Structurally  they never caught up to Clinton. (One former aide described the problem as the ultimate double-edged sword: “The reason that he is a compelling candidate is the same reason he can’t be elected president.”),Positive,1,Positive

6010,1086,Positive,Concerns about hearing loss largely focus on excessive noise exposure. But environmental noise is just as unsafe. People living in cities are regularly exposed (against their will) to noise above 85 decibels from sources like traffic  subways  industrial activity  and airports. That’s enough to cause significant hearing loss over time. If you have an hour-long commute at such sound levels  your hearing has probably already been affected. Urban life also sustains average background noise levels of 60 decibels  which is loud enough to raise one’s blood pressure and heart rate  and cause stress  loss of concentration  and loss of sleep. Sirens are a particularly extreme example of the kind of noise inflicted on people every day: They ring at a sound-pressure level of 120 decibels —a level that corresponds with the human pain threshold  according to the World Health Organization. But since the turn of the 20th century  protecting human hearing has taken a back seat to securing quiet for those with means  and punishing those without. Noise-abatement laws transformed an objective concern about environmental and health conditions into a subjective fight over aesthetic moralism. One of the earliest urban anti-noise campaigns was initiated by  Julia Barnett Rice   the wealthy  well-educated wife of a businessman and publisher. The sound of tugboat horns was causing  Rice  great annoyance as  she  tried to relax in  her  ornate Italianate mansion. But  she  knew that this appeal would fall on deaf ears  so to speak. So  she  decided to use the poor and sick people languishing in urban hospitals as a scapegoat. Isaac Rice  her husband and the publisher of The Forum  became a champion of his wife’s crusade. In 1906  he published  her  piece  “An Effort to Suppress Noise ” which amounts to a call for class antagonism.  She  begins by channeling the pessimistic philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer  who likens noise to boorishness: There are people  it is true—nay  a great many people—who smile at such [sounds]  because they are not sensitive to noise; but they are just the very people who are also not sensitive to argument  or thought  or poetry  or art; in a word  to any kind of intellectual influence. Who are these insipid people in  Rice ’s narrative? The tugboat workers. The piece recounts  [TGT] ’s efforts to ban excessive whistling from aboard their vessels.  [TGT]portrays  [TGT]  as a dogged crusader  pleading for quietude amidst unrelenting clamor.,Positive,1,Positive
6011,1086,Positive,First   [TGT]  sought aid from the law. In the New York City Collector’s Office Law Division   [TGT]  discovered a clause that “seems to vest in the Local Board of Steamboat Inspectors all necessary powers to punish ... any act on the part of a licensed officer that they adjudge to be ‘misconduct’ or ‘negligence’ or ‘unskillfulness.’” In other words   [TGT]attempted to present the call of tugboat horns as professional misconduct. Alas for  her   the U.S. Local Steamboat Inspectors decided that “the point was not well taken.”  [TGT]then went to the police to start a petition drive.  [TGT]  promised signatures from “poor and rich alike ” but sent establishment personalities to collect them. Among the endorsees were wealthy hospital superintendents  who lent credence to  [TGT] ’s claims to help the sick rather than to punish marine workers. The inspectors were still unmoved. When  [TGT]finally interviewed some of the tugboat workers   [TGT]  presented their responses as evidence of wrongdoing rather than as the accounts of workingmen describing their labor. The tugboat captains offered reasonable rationales for sounding whistles. One explained that removing the whistles “would necessitate an extra deckhand to act as messenger to notify the pier hands  besides all the time that would be lost.” Another stated  “We run a risk of losing a whole tide if we do not rouse the crew on the barge.” And yet another  “You must whistle to wake up the crew  which you cannot expect to stay on watch day and night.”,Positive,1,Positive
6012,1086,Positive, [TGT]did not relent.  She  went to maritime academics and higher-ups  who endorsed  her  and researched  her  claim. At last   she  won a victory: The National Board of Steam Navigation passed a resolution prohibiting unnecessary whistle-blowing. The tugboat workers adhered for a day or two  and then  finding that work became impossible and that the National Board had no way of enforcing the resolution  returned to using the horns as often as they liked.  [TGT]had had enough.  [TGT]  proposed a law restricting all but a few scenarios in which tugboats can use their whistles  and demanded a standing representative in the Department of Commerce and Labor who would police the waterways for nuisance. In this effort  too   [TGT]  came away empty-handed. Finally  in one last-ditch effort   [TGT]found success. At a meeting of about 10 000 representatives from the transportation industry  the American Association of Masters  Mates  and Pilots passed a resolution ending the use of “indiscriminate and  above all  noisy signaling.” The law was replicated at the federal level under the 1907 Bennet Act  the first anti-noise bill ratified by Congress.  [TGT] ’s use of the poor and the sick as a tool to pass  [TGT]  legislation played little part in why the authorities finally listened. Researchers had found that the signaling was impacting tugboat navigation  making entering and exiting the harbor confusing and unsafe at night.,Neutral,0,Neutral
6013,1086,Positive,Throughout  Rice ’s entire ordeal   she  presented the tugboat workers as personal enemies rather than potential allies.  Her  plight for quiet was a moral one; as  she  saw it  the peace had been stolen from  her  by the mariners. Looking back   she  comes off as vindictive and elitist. But unfortunately   her  belligerent approach set the stage for subsequent noise-abatement campaigns in cities around the country. As the historian Emily Thompson explains in her book The Soundscape of Modernity  noise-abatement laws singled out relatively powerless people  those who were seen to impede “the middle-class vision of a well-ordered city.” Among these was the 1908 General Order 47  issued by New York City Police Commissioner Thomas Bingham. It targeted street ruckus rather than port noise: commotion from street vendors  newsboys  tin-can kickers  roller skaters  street musicians  automobile horns  flat-wheeled streetcars  and more. Soon after  laws that banned occupational noises  preventing people from working for a living in order to protect the quietude  appeared in Boston; Little Rock  Arkansas; San Francisco; and elsewhere. These fights hit street workers  most of whom were immigrants  hard. Still  the courts upheld the laws. One infamous incident involved a Chicago ordinance that limited peddlers to certain parts of the city and banned them from advertising using shouting. When the courts upheld this law in 1911  the peddlers first went on strike  and then rioted  causing a mass uprising and widespread damages. The police punished the peddlers  the strike was broken  and the law remained on the books. Soon there were no more vendors walking the streets. By the 1920s and ’30s  noise law after noise law helped clear the urban street. Eventually  it ceased to be the domain of people and was overtaken instead by cars—which created their own noise  of course.,Positive,1,Positive
6014,1086,Positive,Noise laws also played a key role in the development and implementation of zoning  the separating of a city’s parcels of land into “zones” for which a specific purpose (such as residential  commercial  or industrial) is assigned. A lasting legacy of  [TGT] ’s tugboat campaign was the concept of “quiet zones”—places where noisemaking was especially prohibited because of its potential harm  such as around hospitals  schools  and the houses of the sick. New York set up its first quiet zones in 1908  aided by  [TGT] ’s work in talking to hospital administrators  and other cities followed soon after. Violating a quiet zone usually constituted a misdemeanor offense  punishable by fine  imprisonment  or both. Enforcing anti-noise ordinances troubled legislators at both the local and national levels  especially when the perpetrator of a noise was an industry vital to a city  a conflict that persists to this day. Interfering with commerce in order to protect silence was perfectly acceptable when it limited barkers  peddlers  or other individuals with little power. But when it came to manufacturers  factories  or the transporters of goods  the risk of disturbing commerce outweighed the benefits to the peace. Also  since noise and its treatment in the law was subjective  anti-noise legislation was often ineffective. Police in urban areas had much more pressing issues at hand anyway. However  the idea of “quiet zones” persisted in urban planning. The first zoning laws took noise into account  designating residential zones in places separate from commerce and industry. Like noise-abatement laws  zoning was also built on a foundation of inequality. One of its earliest uses created boundaries separating black and white families  a practice that persisted even after the Supreme Court struck it down in 1917. Middle-class whites looking to prevent lower-income nonwhites (and to some extent lower-income whites as well) from infiltrating their neighborhoods had to come up with a different legal solution.,Neutral,0,Neutral
6015,1086,Positive,Today  as suburbanites return to cities  they bring the fight for quiet along with them. To gentrify a neighborhood also involves quieting it down. The desire for sonic control in and around the home is prioritized above the social fabric of the city  a practice exemplified by the targeting of arts and music venues that are cited as being partially responsible for neighborhood revival in the first place. In her book Beyond Unwanted Sound  Marie Thompson describes an example from the industrial area of Ouseburn Valley in the United Kingdom. The region had become a hotbed of music and the arts partly because there were few residences to disturb. Eventually  several venues closed after repeated run-ins with the law due to noise complaints. These complaints came not from concerned locals  but from wealthy newcomers buying into new developments built explicitly to capitalize on the area’s vibrant nightlife. The noise that does the most harm doesn’t come from clubs and house parties—the causes of many garden-variety noise complaints and violations. Ironically   [TGT]did get something right in  [TGT]  crusade: Industrial noise poses the worst problem  although individual workers were not to blame for it  as  [TGT]had also concluded. The two largest sources of environmental noise are transportation and industrial activity. The cars for which early noise ordinances helped clear the streets have amplified that noise to a universal  inescapable level. Industrial areas  often designated for land close to the poorest nonwhite areas in a city  are even worse.,Positive,1,Positive
6016,1086,Positive,To solve the environmental-noise problem  cities and their citizens should learn from the mistakes of the past. Targeting the noise of individuals is ineffective  antisocial  and fails to eradicate the noise that really hurts people: environmental noise. Solutions to that problem must be systemic  requiring a large-scale  collective response across many different targets. Despite her intentions  Julia Barnett Rice offers a model. She arrived at success only once she began addressing the marine industry at large. Similar approaches can work today. Instead of punishing individual transportation workers whose trucks may be too old  a more comprehensive solution could target the Department of Transportation  with demands to repave worn roads with the porous asphalt configurations used in Europe to reduce tire noise. Likewise  any move toward using renewable energy sources will result in a quieter environment  as coal and oil extraction are extremely noisy labors. At the local and state level  demanding funding for repairs and improvement to outdated transit infrastructure will greatly reduce the noise caused by trains  cars  and trucks. Urban-planning approaches to eliminating noise on a city-by-city basis can be as simple as taking a single lane away from cars and giving it to bicycles  people  or green space. Improving  expanding  and properly funding public transit removes cars from the road  both reducing the sound they produce and replacing it with quieter options like trams and high-speed light-rail. In architecture  acoustics should play a greater role in all structures  from mundane apartment buildings to the grandest art museums. Noise control should be a consideration from the very first planning stage  rather than tacked on as an afterthought.,Positive,1,Positive

6264,1119,Neutral,We’ve noted before that  Trump  has an insurance premium against any calls for  his  impeachment.  His  popularity with Republicans has slipped since the beginning of  his  presidency  but  he ’s still very popular with them  particularly more conservative members of  his  party. (Per Gallup  more than 9 in 10 conservative Republicans approve of [TGT] .) Because Republican Party primaries see an overrepresentation of conservatives  that meant that Republicans eager to win reelection to Congress were less likely to turn on the president.,Neutral,0,Neutral
6265,1119,Neutral, Trump’s  tweet distancing  himself  from Gillespie sugarcoats the election in a way that may make  [TGT]  feel better but probably isn’t fooling anyone on Capitol Hill.  His  claim that the GOP won four of four federal races misses a few important points. The first is that those races were in Republican-held districts. The second is that the Democrats saw big gains in most of those races relative to past elections. The third is that the figure is actually four of five;  Trump  likes to ignore a race in California won by the Democrats.,Positive,1,Positive
6266,1119,Neutral,But it also does something very dangerous for  Trump  right now. It shows  yet again  that  he  isn’t loyal to  his  political partners.,Neutral,0,Neutral
6267,1119,Neutral,We’ve seen this before. When  Trump  backed the House effort to repeal and replace Obamacare (having no plan of  his  own)   he  responded to  its  passage by declaring the bill to be “mean” — as though  he  hadn’t previously claimed it was nearly without flaws. (It was health care  not immigration  that was the big issue in Virginia  according to exit polls. Northam won among voters concerned about health care by a more than 3-to-1 margin.) Even before Election Day in Alabama earlier this year   Trump  began to distance  himself  from  his  preferred candidate Republican Senate primary  Luther Strange  hinting that  he  had perhaps made a mistake — a shift that was certainly informed by polls showing a likely Strange loss. When that happened   Trump  deleted some of  his  tweets of endorsement.,Neutral,0,Neutral
6268,1119,Neutral,Strange’s campaign  unlike Gillespie’s  didn’t embrace Trumpist politics such as the threat of the gang MS-13.  He  tried to win as a more typical establishment conservative  to no avail. Gillespie tried to more directly embrace  Trump  politics — and lost badly. And then saw  Trump  turn on him.,Positive,1,Positive
6269,1119,Neutral,Think of the message that  Trump  has sent to Republicans. Stand with him on policy and have him bad-mouth what you passed. Embrace his endorsement and see a loss followed by  Trump  playing down his support. Embrace his endorsement and his politics  and see a loss followed by actual criticism. These are all one-offs — but politics generally suffers from a small sample size from which to draw conclusions  and no one spends more time trying to draw conclusions than politicians.,Positive,1,Positive
6270,1119,Neutral,Bannon’s track record in electoral politics? He helped  Trump  lose the popular vote and win the electoral college in 2016. He embraced Luther Strange’s opponent after Strange was trailing. And now he watched the “Trump-Stewart talking points” lead nowhere.,Neutral,0,Neutral
6271,1119,Neutral,On its home page  Breitbart also championed  Trump ’s argument that Gillespie should have embraced him more robustly. That’s a flawed theory.  Trump  is very unpopular in Virginia  and Northam won among those who disapprove of  Trump  by a 7-to-1 margin  according to preliminary exit polls. A third of voters said their vote in the race was meant to send a message of opposition to  Trump  — twice as many as said it was a message of support.,Neutral,0,Neutral
6272,1119,Neutral,What’s more   Trump  made  his  feelings clear. Those who wanted to vote for  Trump’s  candidate knew who that candidate was. As in Alabama  voters went in another direction.,Neutral,0,Neutral
6273,1119,Neutral,It’s critical to remember that Democrats were supposed to win this race  albeit not necessarily by as wide a margin as they did. Democrats hold the governor’s mansion and Hillary Clinton won by five points last year.  Trump  could have congratulated Gillespie on a hard-fought race and noted the uphill battle. Instead   he  decided to try to spin the loss to  his  advantage.,Neutral,0,Neutral
6274,1119,Neutral,It’s unlikely that many Republicans worried about next November will be convinced by  Trump ’s argument. Instead  they’re likely to take another lesson:  Trump  can’t deliver a victory for you when you’re trailing  and neither can Trumpism. (In fact  there’s every reason to think that  Trump  was the liability that  his  poll numbers would suggest  with Gillespie doing fine in western Virginia but getting beaten badly in more-Democratic Northern Virginia.)

6432,1142,Positive,The meeting puts  Schumer  in the awkward position pushing a debate strategy that  he  denounced loudly in 2013. Back then   [TGT]blasted efforts by the GOP to extract Obamacare concessions before accepting the federal budget and insisted that Democrats would not hold up a federal budget to push their immigration priorities.  He  told ABC’s This Week:,Neutral,0,Neutral

6434,1142,Positive, [TGT]is in a weak position also because Democrats embrace the industry-funded “nation of immigrants” polls which shame Americans to say they welcome migrants. But the alternative “fairness” polls show that voters put a much higher priority on helping their families  neighbors  and fellow nationals get decent jobs in a high-tech  high-immigration  low-wage economy. That political power of the voters’ fairness priority was made clear during the GOP primaries and again in November 2016.,Positive,1,Positive
6435,1143,Positive,Nearly two years into Accor SA’s $168 million play for a piece of the home-sharing pie  the multinational hotel group is throwing down the luxury gauntlet: free  round-the-clock concierge service for an entire year after your vacation. Called “Higher Living ” the offering was announced on Friday by  Onefinestay   the luxury rental brand founded in 2009 and acquired by Accor in 2016.,Positive,1,Positive
6436,1143,Positive,Higher Living is being pegged as a loyalty program of sorts as Accor rapidly expands its footprint  becoming the first major hotel group to actively embrace home sharing. Last year they purchased Travel Keys and Squarebreak and merged them with  Onefinestay   quadrupling the rental company’s portfolio overnight  from more than 2 000 units in 13 locales to more than 10 000 rentals in 200-plus destinations.,Positive,1,Positive
6437,1143,Positive,What sets  Onefinestay ’s privately owned properties apart from those on Airbnb  VRBO  and other peer-to-peer sites is that each one—from a beachfront villa in Anguilla to a penthouse in San Francisco—is heavily scrutinized in person and vetted against a checklist of 300 characteristics. In addition  there’s a consistent  hotel-like quality to every stay  from the toiletries (Le Labo in the U.S.  L’Occitane in Paris  for example) to an on-call concierge to procure hard-to-get theater tickets  private chefs  or dog-sledding excursions in Courchevel. Those concierges now staff the Higher Living program.,Positive,1,Positive
6438,1143,Positive,Javier Cedillo-Espin   [TGT]likens Higher Living to the modern-day version of a butler  “almost like a guardian angel delivering local experiences ”  [TGT]  tells Pursuits in an interview.,Positive,1,Positive
6439,1143,Positive,Unlike traditional loyalty programs  Higher Living does not involve points  a tiered structure  or endless marketing emails  and guests are automatically enrolled from the minute a getaway ends. Need help finding a photographer for a family photo shoot? Just call  text  email  or use the dedicated mobile app to ask an on-staff Onefinestay concierge to find one; the only thing you pay for is the photo shoot. Planning your kid’s birthday party? Consider the venue  cake  and decorations handled. You can also use the service to arrange day trips or just send flowers. It’s a doubling down on Onefinestay’s view of itself as a full-fledged hospitality company  rather than merely a place to go for high-end rentals.,Positive,1,Positive
6440,1143,Positive,Rebookings are the ultimate goal for any loyalty program: After 12 months  the program expires unless a new booking is made (or a yet-to-be-decided fee is paid). Book a new trip  and another complimentary year starts immediately. Only the person who pays for a  Onefinestay  property can submit requests to the concierges—something to consider when splitting a rental with another couple or family.,Positive,1,Positive
6441,1143,Positive,Noting  Onefinestay ’s strongly positive word-of-mouth reputation  Cedillo-Espin pegs his company’s success on its ability to foster memorable experiences. “People trust us in a way that they seldom trust brands. And for me  that’s the biggest difference.”,Positive,1,Positive
6442,1143,Positive,Take segment-leader Airbnb Inc. Its 4 million listings and 65 000 cities include upscale properties  but it is far from being perceived as a luxury company. That may all change when its “Lux” tier debuts in the coming months; the new collection will comprise about 4 000 properties from Canada-based Luxury Retreats  which it acquired last year for $300 million—but the peer-to-peer rental behemoth says it has no plans yet to provide a comparable high-touch concierge service. In addition  Airbnb doesn’t pay commissions to travel agents  which Onefinestay does  incentivizing agents to consider its properties on par with hotels.,Neutral,0,Neutral
6443,1143,Positive,“I don’t think [they] necessarily add value or will be a deciding factor as to why someone should book a villa ” he says when asked about concierge programs as rewards in a general sense. (Bloomberg received Onefinestay’s announcement under embargo.) “People booking high-end vacations already have access to tickets and dinner reservations and so on.”,Neutral,0,Neutral
6444,1143,Positive,This sentiment especially makes sense when you consider that  [TGT] are  non-exclusive and listed on booking platforms with less personalized attention; the high-touch human element is the only thing setting  [TGT]  apart.,Positive,1,Positive
6445,1143,Positive,However Higher Living shakes out   [TGT]will continue fine-tuning [TGT] inventory  proactively adding and dropping homes. [TGT] beach collection includes more than 4 000 rentals from Hawaii to Bali; in 2018  [TGT] is looking to expand in the south of France and Greece. In the countryside  Provence  France  Tuscany  Italy  and Napa  Calif.  will remain a focus  and the ski chalet collection will see growth in the North American market  including Vail and Aspen in Colorado and Lake Tahoe on the Nevada-California border.,Positive,1,Positive
6446,1143,Positive,More than anything else  Cedillo-Espin believes he is in the business of making people happy  and  [TGT]prides  [TGT]  on  [TGT]  ability to deliver not only on wow-factor accommodations  but hot-air balloon rides and Alpine motor-skiing excursions to match. “The customer has become more demanding about what they require ” he says. “There are millions of experiences out there  and we’re focused on making sure they have the very best.”,Positive,1,Positive

6587,1161,Positive,Selected ninth in the first round of the 2000 draft   Urlacher  becomes the first Hall of Fame playerfrom the University of New Mexico.  [TGT]  was named NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year and was an established star before coach Lovie Smith arrived in 2004 with a scheme that accentuated  [TGT] ’s freakish athletic ability for a player with such a large frame — 6-foot-4  258 pounds. The next year  he  was named the league’s Defensive Player of the Year  becoming the fifth player to win both awards. The next season  in 2006   Urlacher  helped lead the Bears to Super Bowl XLI.,Positive,1,Positive
6588,1161,Positive,Named to the NFL’s All-Decade Team of the 2000s   [TGT]was selected to the Pro Bowl eight times and was first team All-Pro five times. In 13 seasons  according to pro-football-reference.com   he  amassed 1 354 tackles  41½ sacks  22 interceptions  two touchdowns  90 passes defensed  11 forced fumbles and 15 fumble recoveries.,Positive,1,Positive
6589,1161,Positive,Personnel boss Mark Hatley made the decision to draft Urlacher  who had played safety in college. The Bears knew they were getting a player who could transform their defense but initially weren’t sure how to deploy  him .,Positive,1,Positive
6590,1161,Positive,“We knew we would like to play  him  at the mike (middle) linebacker  but the problem was  he  had been a safety  and we didn’t want to stick  him  there right away and beat  him  up and lose  him  and ruin an excellent prospect ” defensive coordinator Greg Blache said. “We started  him  off at the sam (strong-side) linebacker position  where everything is coming at you from one direction in the traffic  and we played  him  at the mike in the nickel situation  where 95 percent of it was passing. So  he  was getting a feel for it but  he  wasn’t getting in the heavy traffic with the guards coming on  him  and combination blocks … because it’s a whole different beast when you’re playing 12 to 15 yards deep as a safety and you move up to 5 yards from the line of scrimmage with the 300-pounders.,Positive,1,Positive
6591,1161,Positive,“We knew we had something special and we knew  he  would be a guy who would be a hell of a player for a long  long time if we had some patience and were just judicious in how we approached it. Having (linebackers coach) Dale Lindsey there was a huge help because Dale had developed so many linebackers and he was a great voice in saying he had seen rush jobs when guys were put in situations they weren’t quite ready to handle. It ended up working out really well just because we got him eased into it to the point where he was comfortable seeing it all happen.”,Positive,1,Positive
6592,1161,Positive,It happened faster than anyone would have imagined  which in retrospect isn’t surprising to anyone who was involved. Lindsey marveled at the amount of information  Urlacher  could process and then apply on the field. A lot of players  even really good ones  can lose the fine details when they move from the meeting room to the practice field and then into games  but  Urlacher  absorbed it all.,Positive,1,Positive
6593,1161,Positive,When middle linebacker Barry Minter was sidelined with a back injury in the third week of the 2000 season  the Bears moved  Urlacher . They never again discussed where  [TGT]  was best suited to play or what  [TGT]  could handle.,Positive,1,Positive
6594,1161,Positive,“(Head coach) Dick Jauron said  ‘Put  him  at the middle ’ ” Lindsey said. “Dick could see the big picture. Luckily for us  [TGT] was more than willing to learn the new position. It’s nice when you have rare talent and a guy who wants to do it. That’s the difference between the real great players — they want to do it and they’ll do anything to be successful. He was like a sponge. You just kept giving him information and he absorbed it and would want more. The thing about the guys with the rare talent: They can do any damn thing you ask them. You can ask them the impossible and they can get it done. And [TGT] did it for us as a great middle linebacker.”,Positive,1,Positive
6595,1161,Positive,When the Bears signed massive defensive tackles Ted Washington and Keith Traylor in 2001   Urlacher  raised  his  game to a new level as the duo kept offensive linemen off of  him  and allowed  him  to make plays with  his  remarkable speed.,Positive,1,Positive
6596,1161,Positive,“There are a lot of guys who can run fast in a straight line  but the athleticism  he  showed for a guy that size  off the charts ” Blache said.,Positive,1,Positive
6597,1161,Positive,He spearheaded the “Monday Night Miracle” at Arizona in 2006 with 25 tackles and a forced fumble that resulted in a touchdown.  Urlacher  had five interceptions and five sacks in 2007  a testament to  his  ability to do anything needed.,Positive,1,Positive
6598,1161,Positive, Urlacher  was never very comfortable in the spotlight but always at ease around  his  teammates  which made  him  immensely popular.  He  treated the newest rookie the same way  he  did the most tenured veterans. When former teammate Todd Johnson became a high school coach in Sarasota  Fla.  he didn’t have enough uniforms to dress all of his players.  Urlacher  provided new jerseys — home and away — for the entire roster and did so without seeking any attention  one of countless anecdotes of how  he  helped friends.,Positive,1,Positive

Stephen Miller’s mindless  repetitive defense of  Trump  to CNN’s Jake Tapper got him cut off and then escorted out of the building. Let  Trump  be a prepared president with a task so simple even  he  can’t blow it. Instead they had to watch in horror as  he  failed to perform. When Rep. Kevin McCarthy is the smart one in the room and you have to erase incriminating parts of the transcript like a Kremlin operative  you know it’s been a spectacular failure.,Neutral,0,Neutral
6609,1163,Neutral, Trump’s  display cracks  his  truce with Capitol Hill after pushing through tax cuts. House conservatives in the Freedom Caucus feel as warmly about  Trump ’s Bill of Love as they did about the Summer of Love. Their limited openness to agree to a non-monolithic wall — more fencing and high-tech surveillance and less money for an actual wall — is dead in light of  Trump ’s televised squishiness.

Aside from giving in to  his  Democratic captors  all the king’s men couldn’t keep  him  from going off script to long nostalgically for the olden days of Jack Abramoff memorial earmarks.,Negative,-1,Negative
6611,1163,Neutral,"Trump inadvertently demonstrated what Wolff  convinced of his own superiority  could not do in round-the-clock interviews with friendly anchors: that despite Wolff himself being above the rigor and rules of mere journalists  on the larger truth he is right. The president is impulsive  uncontrollable and unteachable  burdened with an ignorance he doesn’t have the self-awareness to realize he has or the discipline to overcome it. Rather than show he's ""like  really smart"" and went to ""the best colleges for college ""  Trump  showed that the job reduced to  its  simplest level is beyond  his  grasp leaving  his  advisers sickened like parents watching their well-coached child put a square peg in a round hole at a pre-school admissions interview.",Neutral,0,Neutral

6745,1182,Neutral,Celebrity chef [TGT]  currently a judge on “The Great American Baking Show ” says he’s “shattered and heartbroken” over recent accusations of sexual misconduct by four of his former employees.,Positive,1,Positive
6746,1182,Neutral,The first woman  a pastry chef  told Mic she resigned after two years of employment at Jean-Georges  during which time  Iuzzini  would sneak up beside her and put  his  tongue in her ear — a tactic  he  repeated “three or four times.” She also said  he  would touch the employees’ rear ends with kitchen utensils or long vegetables.,Neutral,0,Neutral
6747,1182,Neutral,A second pastry chef claims  Iuzzini  once ran up behind her and simulated a sex act on her. “He didn’t actually grind up on my butt  but his hands were on my hips ” she told Mic. “He did it for five seconds and ran out.” At the time  the chef says she didn’t think she should report the behavior  lest it ruin her career.,Neutral,0,Neutral
6748,1182,Neutral,Two externs  who were unpaid  also reported inappropriate behavior on  Iuzzini ’s part  including his frequent requests for shoulder rubs  his penchant for crude humor  and the time he showed one of them a photo of a woman’s genitals.,Neutral,0,Neutral
6749,1182,Neutral,One extern also says she engaged in a three-month sexual relationship with  Iuzzini  when she was 19  which began the day before she interviewed for her extern position. According to her statement to Mic  she remembers it being hard to refuse his advances. “If one person has all the power  it’s not really consent ” she said.,Neutral,0,Neutral
6750,1182,Neutral,Two of the women who spoke to Mic believed that the management of Jean-Georges may have learned about Iuzzuni’s behavior shortly before  Iuzzini  left in 2011.  Iuzzini   however  wrote that  he  “maintains a good relationship” with  his  mentor Jean-Georges Vongerichten  and gave three months’ notice of  his  departure.,Neutral,0,Neutral
6751,1182,Neutral, Iuzzini  also denied that  he  suffered from a substance abuse problem  or that  he  angrily assaulted an employee with a nitrogen canister — accusations leveled against  him  by an extern and the pastry chefs  respectively — but  he  said he “takes responsibility if any of the members of my team felt uncomfortable ” even if their accusations are “inaccurate.”,Neutral,0,Neutral

6753,1183,Positive,Five years ago  [TGT]was living with some friends in Bloomington  Ind.  and  [TGT]  found  [TGT]  wondering how much time  [TGT]  spent doing one of  [TGT]  roommates’ dishes. [TGT] had a handheld electronic datebook that  [TGT]  purchased on a trip to Tokyo   and on May 11  2005  at 2:20 p.m.   [TGT]  started using it to keep a record of  [TGT]  actions. Instead of entering  [TGT]  future appointments   [TGT]  entered  [TGT]  past activities  creating a remarkably complete account of  [TGT]  life. In one sense this was just a normal personal journal  albeit in a digital format and unusually detailed. But the format and detail made all the difference.  [TGT]eventually transferred the data to  [TGT]  computer  and now  using a few keyboard commands   [TGT]  can call up  [TGT]  history.  [TGT]  knows how much  [TGT]  has eaten and how much  [TGT]  has spent.  [TGT]  knows what books  [TGT]  has read and what objects  [TGT]  has purchased. And of course   [TGT]  knows the answer to  [TGT]  original question. “I was thinking I was spending an hour a day cleaning up after this person ” [TGT] says.  [TGT]  shrugs. “It turned out it was more like 20 minutes.”,Positive,1,Positive
6754,1183,Positive,These men all know that their behavior is abnormal. They are outliers. Geeks. But why does what they are doing seem so strange? In other contexts  it is normal to seek data. A fetish for numbers is the defining trait of the modern manager. Corporate executives facing down hostile shareholders load their pockets full of numbers. So do politicians on the hustings  doctors counseling patients and fans abusing their local sports franchise on talk radio. Charles Dickens was already making fun of this obsession in 1854  with his sketch of the fact-mad schoolmaster Gradgrind  who blasted his students with memorized trivia. But Dickens’s great caricature only proved the durability of the type. For another century and a half   [TGT]  got worse.,Negative,-1,Negative
6755,1183,Positive,Or  by another standard  you could say  [TGT]  got better. We tolerate the pathologies of quantification — a dry  abstract  mechanical type of knowledge — because the results are so powerful. Numbering things allows tests  comparisons  experiments. Numbers make problems less resonant emotionally but more tractable intellectually. In science  in business and in the more reasonable sectors of government  numbers have won fair and square.,Positive,1,Positive
6756,1183,Positive,I recently received an e-mail message from a 26-year-old filmmaker named Toli Galanis  who keeps track of about 50 different streams of personal data  including activities  health  films watched and books read  the friends he talks with and the topics they discuss. While Galanis acknowledged that he gets pleasure from gathering data and organizing  [TGT]  intelligently   [TGT]  was a different aspect of his report that caught my attention. “I know that immediately after watching a bad movie I am more apt to be negative about my career prospects as a filmmaker ” he wrote  explaining that tracking has made him better able to detect the influence of seemingly trivial circumstances on his mood and decisions.,Neutral,0,Neutral

6785,1187,Positive,Jordan Howard  followed up  his  1 313-yard rookie season with 1 122 yards.  He  had an outside shot at the NFL’s rushing title early in December but faded in the final three games with only 90 yards on 41 carries.  He  became the first back in franchise history to begin  his  career with consecutive 1 000-yard seasons and amassed 2 000 career rushing yards faster than any back in club history  getting there in 24 games. The great Walter Payton needed 26 games.,Positive,1,Positive

6788,1187,Positive,2017 season review:  Howard  had five 100-yard games and has never been better than  he  was during the 27-24 overtime victory against the Ravens in Baltimore on Oct. 15.  He  carried a career-high 36 times for 167 yards and put the Bears in position for the game-winning field goal.  Howard  likely would have been more effective through the season  but the coaching staff seemed conflicted as to what it wanted to achieve on certain weeks.  Howard  had four games in which  he  received 10 carries or fewer and only six games in which  he  had 20 or more carries. The Bears realized that  Howard  needed a solid workload throughout a game to really get  him  lathered up  but then that approach failed to account for Cohen. Mixing it all together was a struggle because at the end of the season the Bears ran only 934 offensive plays — 31st in the league. To put that in perspective  they were about 70 snaps behind teams that ranked in the middle of the pack  so a little more than four per game. Not that big of a deal over the course of the season  but 25 more handoffs to  Howard  could have meant another 100-plus yards  right?,Neutral,0,Neutral
6789,1187,Positive, Howard  now has 12 career 100-yard games  which ties  him  with the Cowboys’ ’ Ezekiel Elliott for the most over the last two seasons. It also puts  Howard  seventh in franchise history behind Payton 77  Matt Forte 24  Gale Sayers 20  Neal Anderson 14  Rick Casares 13 and Thomas Jones 13. The Bears are only 5-7 in games in which  Howard  tops 100 yards  but when you consider their record when  he ’s held under 100 is 8-24  you see the value.,Positive,1,Positive
6790,1187,Positive,The biggest issue for  Howard  is it’s hard to call  him  a complete back.  He ’s never going to be Forte  who set the NFL record for receptions in a season by a back with 102 in 2014. But  Howard  would be much more dangerous if [TGT][TGT]was a more consistent threat as a receiver.  He  caught only 23 passes for 125 yards (six fewer receptions and 173 fewer yards than  he  produced as a rookie). Nine running backs topped 1 000 rushing yards this season and every one had more receptions than  Howard ’s 23. In fact  the average was 58. (Chiefs rookie running back Kareem Hunt had 53). Over the last five seasons there have been 53 1 000-yard seasons in the NFL. Only six of those 53 produced fewer catches than  Howard ’s 23 this year:,Positive,1,Positive
6791,1187,Positive,The outlier on this list is Gurley. He has had 107 receptions in the two seasons since that low output as a rookie.  Howard ’s inability to make more plays in the passing game — and  he  was tied for ninth in the league with five dropped passes (and  he  was targeted only 32 times) — is holding his game back. He’s been terrific running the ball and just might be poised for greater things under new coach Matt Nagy (more on that in a little bit)  but he has been deficient in the passing game.,Neutral,0,Neutral

6796,1188,Positive,Tourism is one of a shrinking range of North Korean cash sources not targeted by United Nations sanctions  and the brochures advertise to foreign investors some $1.5 billion worth of potential ventures in the Wonsan Special Tourist Zone  an area covering more than 400 square km (150 square miles).  Kim  has already constructed a ski resort and a new airport there.,Positive,1,Positive

6798,1188,Positive,Earlier this year  Kim  sent 16 of  his  officials to Spain to get ideas for Wonsan.

6800,1188,Positive,Even so  the plan is strategically vital for  Kim   say former North Korean diplomats. When  he  came to power in 2011   he  inherited a society officially run by the military but whose people survived largely on black market dealings. On paper  North Korea is a state-run economy; but in fact  seven in 10 North Koreans depend on private trade to live  according to Thae Yong Ho  North Korea’s former deputy ambassador in London  who staged a high-profile defection with his family in 2016.,Positive,1,Positive
6801,1188,Positive, Kim  is perceived by outsiders as all powerful  but North Korea’s free marketeers make  him  more vulnerable than  he  seems  Thae told Reuters.  The leader  is looking for a way to harness both military and market forces to survive.,Positive,1,Positive
6802,1188,Positive,Nuclear weapons are one part of  his  answer – because  Kim  hopes they will cost less to maintain than North Korea’s conventional heavy weapons. Projects like Wonsan are the other part.  He  wants to cut the share of funding  he  gives to the military and allocate more money to the civilian economy.,Positive,1,Positive

7153,1235,Positive,In a stunning turn of events Sunday evening  Tennessee and Ohio State defensive coordinator  [TGT]backed out of a deal for  [TGT]  to become the Volunteers football coach after unprecedented social media backlash to reports  including one from USA TODAY Sports  that the hire was imminent.,Positive,1,Positive

7155,1235,Positive,Tennessee athletics director John Currie flew to Columbus  Ohio  on Sunday in hopes of culminating the deal and bringing  [TGT]back to Knoxville for a news conference. The paperwork was in the process of being finalized when the decision was made to reassess the situation.,Positive,1,Positive
7156,1235,Positive,"Part of the backlash stems from  Schiano 's connection to Penn State and Jerry Sandusky. Testimony that was unsealed last year detailed former Penn State assistant coach Mike McQueary's claim that he heard that [TGT]who was an assistant with the Nittany Lions  had witnessed Sandusky ""doing something"" to a boy in the shower.""",Positive,1,Positive
7157,1236,Positive,The architect of the club’s success is its English head coach Graham Potter. English coaches have changed Swedish soccer in the past  with Bob Houghton and Roy Hodgson introducing a more direct English style of soccer to the country  and winning a host of titles between them  Houghton even leading Malmö FF to the final of the European Cup. Their legacy has endured in the way many clubs in Sweden play their soccer  but when  [TGT]joined Östersunds   [TGT]  wanted the club to change its soccer philosophy away from the direct style of many Swedish clubs  and introduce a more tactically flexible  possession-based style of play where players have the chance to develop.,Positive,1,Positive
7158,1236,Positive,Moving to Sweden was a risk. Before  joining Östersunds FK  [TGT]had been coaching with the relatively safe confines of university-level soccer in England.  [TGT]  moved to Sweden for the challenge of coaching in professional soccer and the opportunity to create an identity for the club.  [TGT]was attracted by the chairman’s vision for Östersunds  but  [TGT]  joined a side that had just been relegated  and was low on morale. The job was made harder by the club’s location in the small town of Östersund in central Sweden  a quiet backwater of 50 000 people  far to the north of Stockholm  Malmö and Gothenburg on Sweden’s southern coast. When Östersunds were outside Sweden’s top two tiers  getting players to move up north was a challenge  so [TGT] changed the club’s recruitment strategy  even bringing in some young  hungry players from England who had fallen through the cracks of the English system.,Neutral,0,Neutral
7159,1236,Positive,One of those players was Jamie Hopcutt. He scored in Östersunds’ Europa Cup qualifying match against Galatasaray  but before joining the Swedish club  he was playing his football for Tadcaster Albion in the ninth tier of English soccer. Hopcutt got an email from LFE  a program that helps players who have been released from professional teams  offering him a place on a trial day at Östersunds. He told me that  [TGT]had coached  [TGT]  when he was a young boy at York City  and as being a professional soccer player was Hopcutt’s ‘ultimate dream’  the then-19-year-old didn’t take much convincing to up sticks and move to Sweden’s ‘winter city’.,Positive,1,Positive
7160,1236,Positive, Graham Potter  has tried to make Östersunds FK a low-pressure environment-- no easy thing in the results-driven soccer business. Supported by club chairman Daniel Kindberg  who says soccer ‘is a mental game about decision making and courage’   [TGT]built confidence and team spirit through some surprising methods  such as getting the players to perform ‘Swan Lake’ to fans and locals. His aim is to create players that are brave and can think clearly in a stressful situation.,Neutral,0,Neutral
7161,1236,Positive,Rather than focusing solely on results   [TGT]says  it ’s more important to create a good environment where players aren’t afraid of losing and have responsibility for their own decisions.,Negative,-1,Positive
7162,1236,Positive,Even without the Europa League  Östersunds FK’s journey has been an incredible achievement. When  [TGT]joined the club  it was at  [TGT]  lowest ebb  with less than a thousand people turning up to cheer on the team. Now around 6 000 fans attend Östersunds FK’s matches and some of its players  like midfielder Ken Sema  are pushing for a place in Sweden’s World Cup squad. Östersunds’ Europa League journey saw the side knock out Galatasaray and Greek side PAOK  and in the group stage Östersunds only missed out on top spot to Athletic Bilbao on goal difference. Whether Östersunds win or lose against Arsenal  the last few years have been a fairytale for the small club from central Sweden  but it’s a fairytale based on creating the right environment for players to succeed   and showing trust and faith in players that other clubs might not have considered.,Positive,1,Positive
7163,1237,Positive,On Tuesday   [TGT]released  [TGT]  full-length remake of Attack of the Clones starring  [TGT]  friends.

7165,1237,Positive,This is the second time  [TGT]and  [TGT]  pals have remade an entire Star Wars movie from scratch  following a brilliant Revenge of the Sith remake that reenacted the entire climactic Anakin/Obi-Wan fight scene on a beach at low tide or whatever. This new one doesn't have as many iconic moments as the first  but the low-budget remake of Clones drastically improves on that wack-ass battle between Dooku and Yoda and  somehow  manages to sell those wooden romance lines better than Natalie Portman. The arena scene is also particularly transcendent.,Positive,1,Positive
7166,1237,Positive,"""The entire film was once again shot on a Samsung J5 and our total budget was $25 "" Hoekstra wrote about the new remake. ""All the props were junk we had lying around... our main motivation was to have some fun and hang out.""",Neutral,0,Neutral

7184,1241,Positive,In a defiant and error-laden tweetstorm that was remarkable even by  his  own combative standards   Trump  stewed aloud about the latest indictments brought by special counsel Robert Mueller against Russians for their elaborate campaign to denigrate the Democratic presidential nominee  Hillary Clinton  and push voters toward  Trump .,Positive,1,Positive
7185,1241,Positive," The president  seized on Mueller's evidence of the expansive scope of the Russian influence efforts to claim that the indictments exonerated  him  and proved there was ""no collusion."" But the special counsel's investigation of possible complicity between Russia and the  Trump  campaign is continuing  as is the examination of whether  Trump  has sought to obstruct justice.",Positive,1,Positive
7186,1241,Positive,In a string of 10 Twitter messages — which began after 11 p.m. Saturday and ended around noon Sunday  and which included profanity and misspellings —  Trump  opened a window into  his  state of mind  even as  Trump 's representatives at a global security conference in Germany advised jittery allies to generally ignore the president's tweets.,Positive,1,Positive
7187,1241,Positive," Trump 's latest attacks built on remarks last week in which  he  misrepresented the evidence revealed by Mueller.  He  tweeted falsely  ""I never said Russia did not meddle in the election.""  He  blamed President Barack Obama's administration for doing ""nothing"" to stop the intrusion.  Trump  rebuked national security adviser H.R. McMaster for publicly saying the evidence of Russian interference was ""incontrovertible.""",Positive,1,Positive

7192,1241,Positive, Trump  sent the messages from  his  Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach  Fla.  where  he  was ensconced for two days.  He  spent much of the time watching cable news  venting to friends about the Russia investigation and complaining that it has been driving so much press coverage  according to people who have spoken to  him .  The president  also surveyed Mar-a-Lago Club members about whether  he  ought to champion gun control measures in the wake of last week's school massacre in nearby Parkland  telling them that  he  was closely monitoring the media appearances by some of the surviving students  according to people who spoke with  him  there.,Positive,1,Positive

Also last week   Trump 's longtime personal lawyer  Michael Cohen  said that shortly before the 2016 election he had used his personal funds to ""facilitate"" a $130 000 payment to a porn star who goes by the name Stormy Daniels and had alleged a sexual relationship with  Trump .",Positive,1,Positive

[TGT]implored Novartis to price Kymriah fairly.,Positive,1,Positive
7458,1280,Positive,The next day  with FDA approval in hand  Novartis announced the new therapy would cost $475 000 per treatment. I spoke to  Mitchell  last week about  [TGT]  meeting with Novartis and  [TGT]  reaction to Kymriah’s pricetag. Ben Wakana  the executive director of Patients for Affordable Drugs  also joined parts of our conversation below. Their campaign  while relatively new  is an extremely polished one. Before working on Patients for Affordable Drugs  [TGT] was a partner at GMBB  a communications firm perhaps best known for cutting ads for Democrats  and Wakana was spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services. The nonprofit is funded with half a million from the Laura and John Arnold Foundation in addition to $75 000 of Mitchell’s own savings and another $75 000 they have since fundraised. A transcript of our conversation  edited and condensed for clarity  is below. Butch Ramsey Sarah Zhang: So how is your health these days? [TGT]: My health status is great. I’m a very lucky man. The drugs I’m using are working and I am tolerating them very well. I am relapsed  so I'm into the second line of drugs. Myeloma finds its way around drugs. It mutates and changes  so I need new drugs and innovation if I want to live as long as I hope to. You know  watch my youngest son graduate from college  that'd be cool. Have a grandchild  that would be cool.,Neutral,0,Neutral
7459,1280,Positive,Ben Wakana: You would have to ask Novartis. I will throw out a hypothesis  which is we sent Novartis a letter and said we’re asking you to price this drug fairly. At the same time we started a petition where we said to people  “Tell Novartis to price this drug in accordance with the fact that U.S. taxpayers spent $200 million researching CAR therapy.” In within 11 days  we got 3 455 people to sign that petition. I would like to think when patients speak up  and we're an organization that represents patients  that has an impact on people. Now it could just have been [then Novartis CEO] Joseph Jimenez was in a good mood one day and told his folks to meet with us. Zhang: How did the meeting with Novartis go? Mitchell: [laughs] It was a very polite meeting—what do they call it in diplomatic circles? There was a frank exchange. It was about an hour and 15 minutes long. Novartis talked maybe 45 or 50 minutes of that hour and 15  and mainly they explained to us why the drug had to be so expensive and why “financial toxicity” is not their fault; it's the fault of the health-care system   [TGT] 's insurers   [TGT] 's pharmacy benefit managers   it 's doctors  hospitals  it's everything else  it's not them. They're innovators  and the problem is a screwed-up system. And then they spent a lot of time explaining why the drug had to be so expensive. We hoped to actually have a discussion. They just told us why it had to be expensive. They used a word that drug companies often use in conversations that I have had with them. They said  “It’s very complex  David.”,Neutral,0,Neutral
7460,1280,Positive,Zhang: As you know  Novartis disputes the $200 million figure because not all of that money went directly to CAR-T for cancer or toward the specific therapy behind Kymriah.  [TGT] : We're going to send you a clip from a blog post by Francis Collins  the head of the National Institutes of Health  in which  he  explains the long history of NIH in building the foundational science for CAR-T. Here's our position: From 1993 until 2017  NIH invested more than $200 million in the overall science of CAR-T. Even the seminal paper that was published in August of 2011 by Dr. Carl June of the University of Pennsylvania was funded in part by the NIH. All of the makers—Novartis  Kite (which will become Gilead)  and Juno [other companies pursuing CAR-T cell therapy]—are standing on that foundational science. The taxpayers invested early when the risk was the greatest. Zhang: What do you think is a fair price for Kymriah? [TGT]: Well  we have run the numbers a variety of different ways. Now  the point is no one knows the real numbers except Novartis  so we go back to the statements in a Reuters article in 2015 where Kite’s chief financial officer said they thought the base price was $150 000 for treatment  and analysts at that time were saying [costs could be] up to $300 000. When we tried to model  we can’t get over $300 000. Zhang: Novartis did take two unusual steps when announcing the price of Kymriah. First  they pointed to a British analysis to say they actually thought Kymriah was worth $600 000 to $750 000 but they were going to price it lower at $475 000. And second  they said patients who don’t respond after 30 days to the treatment will not have to pay.,Positive,1,Positive
7461,1280,Positive,[TGT]: Now we don't know if that's the right end point because [TGT] turns out over 20 percent of people relapse in six months. So maybe [TGT] would more genuine of them to suggest they give a refund to people who relapse at six months or within six months. “It's not about you as one individual company; it's about the emergence of a new class of therapy.” Zhang: Why did you set your sights on Novartis and their therapy Kymriah in the first place? [TGT]: First of all  we work on all drugs. We work with people who have all diseases from high blood pressure and cardiac disease to multiple sclerosis and cystic fibrosis. However  we decided that it was important to focus on the emergence of a whole new class of therapies. We need to put focus and energy on CAR-T and Novartis got our attention because it's first. And we told them that when we went to visit with them. It's not about you as one individual company; it's about the emergence of a new class of therapy. Zhang: What else does Patients for Affordable Drugs do?  [TGT] : This week we're incredibly busy. We're helping support a rally at Eli Lilly to protest the skyrocketing prices of insulin. Insulin prices have increased more than 300 percent in the last decade. It's outrageous and people are suffering because of it. There's a rally at Eli Lilly September 9  and we'll be supporting that. One of our staff is getting on a plane to go to California to help work in support of SB-17  which is a bill in California for transparency and early notification of drug price increases. We are mobilizing our community out there and will in fact have one of our patients at a news conference there.,Positive,1,Positive

7489,1287,Positive,[TGT]looks like the dad in a Disney movie.  [TGT] ’s earnest  geeky  pink  and slightly bulbous.  [TGT]  idea of salty language is bullcrap. The atmosphere at  Beck’s  Mercury Studios  outside Dallas  is similarly soothing  provided you ignore the references to genocide and civilizational collapse. In October  when most commentators considered a Donald Trump presidency a remote possibility  I followed audience members onto the set of The Glenn Beck Program  which airs on  Beck ’s website  theblaze.com. On the way  we passed through a life-size replica of the Oval Office as it might look if inhabited by a President Beck  complete with a portrait of Ronald Reagan and a large Norman Rockwell print of a Boy Scout. On one side of the main stage hung a drawing of an old pickup truck  captioned “Edward Janssen Farms.” (Janssen was Beck’s maternal grandfather; Beck’s family sells a line of American-made clothing that bears the Janssen name.) Over the truck  in large type  was the word honor. On the other side of the stage sat an old-fashioned radio and a comfy blue armchair. The scene was warmly reassuring  except for the television offstage  which was blaring an advertisement for a year’s worth of “emergency survival food” to be consumed in case society unravels.,Positive,1,Positive
7490,1287,Positive, Beck  asked an audience member to lead a prayer  then filming started. Someone asked  “How do we get people to come together?”  Beck  responded by citing a book called Pendulum  which argues that as the result of generational change  history shifts in 40-year cycles between “me” eras and “we” eras. In 2003  he explained  America entered a “we” era  a time when individual identity weakens and group identity strengthens. “ ‘We’ generations ”  Beck  declared  produce “genocidal monsters”: The past three “we” generations coincided with the French and American revolutions  Karl Marx and the Civil War  and the Holocaust. Americans can survive the coming “onslaught ”  he  reassured  his  viewers  but to do so will require great character.  He  mentioned Dietrich Bonhoeffer  who was hanged for resisting the Nazis.  He  invoked Gandhi  who fasted in an effort to prevent India’s Hindus and Muslims from murdering each other. Then  Beck  stopped for a commercial break  during which  he  chatted amiably with  his  audience about the impending collapse of America’s banks. Later in the show  a questioner suggested that Americans were turning away from God.  Beck  said  he ’d been thinking a lot about the prophet Jeremiah  who vainly warned the Israelite kings that catastrophe was near. Finally  when the Babylonians were about to sack Jerusalem  Jeremiah urged the Israelites to accept national enslavement  because it was God’s will.  Beck  saw a contemporary lesson: “Sometimes you have to pay the price for what you’ve done.” Then  he  started talking about Donald Trump’s assault on the Bill of Rights.,Positive,1,Positive
7491,1287,Positive,Amidst the misery of the 2016 presidential campaign   Beck  showed unusual courage. Many conservative pundits opposed Trump. But they mostly worked for mainstream media institutions like The New York Times  The Washington Post  MSNBC  and CNN. They didn’t rely on Trump supporters to pay their salary. Conservative talk-show hosts  who stoke right-wing populism for a living  reacted very differently. Sean Hannity appeared in one of Trump’s campaign videos. Laura Ingraham spoke at the Republican National Convention. Rush Limbaugh declared in March that  “with the case of Trump  there’s a much bigger upside than downside.” In July  Hugh Hewitt wrote  “Of course I am voting for Donald Trump.” Even the most moralistic conservative talkers—including William Bennett and Dennis Prager  who have made careers of arguing that private character is key to political leadership—endorsed Trump. Mark Levin  who hosts a popular show on the Westwood One radio network  vowed not to. “Count me as Never Trump ” he declared in April. But in September he announced  “I’m voting for Trump.” Among big-time national conservative talk-show hosts  Beck—who is tied with Levin for the third-largest listenership after Limbaugh and Hannity—was a rare exception. He didn’t just oppose Trump. He compared him to Hitler. He warned that Trump was a possible “extinction-level event” for American democracy and capitalism. In an attempt to defeat Trump   Beck  campaigned during the primaries for Ted Cruz. Then  when Cruz endorsed Trump   Beck  apologized for having supported him.,Positive,1,Positive
7492,1287,Positive,One longtime sponsor of  Beck ’s radio show reportedly tried to pull its ads in protest. In May  SiriusXM briefly suspended  Beck  for implying that if Congress wouldn’t stop a President Trump  Americans might have to do so by force. Nonetheless   Beck  held firm in  his  opposition.  He  considered voting for Hillary Clinton  but ultimately went for the independent candidate Evan McMullin. Why? The answer lies in the very catastrophizing that makes  Beck  sound like a kook. In the mid-1990s   Beck  was  by  his  own account  a “despicable human being ” a divorced  alcoholic  drug-addicted shock jock for a Connecticut radio station.  He  once put on a banana suit and leaped into a pool of Styrofoam.  He  repeatedly considered suicide. Eventually  Beck  got sober and fell in love with the woman who would become  his  second wife. But she refused to marry  him  until they found a religion. So the couple embarked on a “church tour” and were baptized as Mormons in 1999. Many Americans revere the Constitution. Mormons like  Beck  consider it sacred. For a time   Beck  remained apolitical. “I didn’t pay attention to anything until September 11  nothing  nothing ”  he  explained to me after the taping  as we sat in  his  office. “I couldn’t have told you the Bill of Rights in any great detail.”  He  describes 9/11 as “a turning point for me.”  He  was by then hosting a show in New York  and remembers walking from Ground Zero to  his  studio and reading on air a 19th-century hymn written by a Mormon pioneer fleeing Missouri on  his  way to Utah.  Beck  says  he  felt a special calling at that moment. “If you have a position on the gate and you don’t warn the people of what you see ”  he  remembers thinking  “you’re to blame.”,Neutral,0,Neutral
7493,1287,Positive,Ever since   Beck  has imagined  himself  as a sentry perched on the national ramparts  warning of looming disaster. Usually  that disaster manifests itself as a threat to the Constitution. Which  given Mormon history  makes perfect sense. Many Americans revere the Constitution. Mormons  however  consider it sacred. In Doctrine and Covenants  a book of Mormon scripture  God says  “I have established the Constitution of this land by the hands of wise men whom I raised up unto this very purpose.” According to polling by David Campbell  a Notre Dame political scientist  94 percent of American Mormons believe that the “Constitution and the Bill of Rights are divinely inspired.” That’s only two points lower than the percentage who believe that the Book of Mormon is. But Mormons don’t just consider the Constitution sacred. They believe that its violation has allowed their persecution. Why did the governor of Missouri in 1838 call for Mormons to “be exterminated or driven from the State”? Why were Mormons forced to travel halfway across the continent—leaving the borders of what was then the United States—in order to find sanctuary in Utah? Because America’s leaders disregarded the country’s sacred texts. Today  many Mormons see defending the Constitution the way many Jews see opposing genocide: as a way of honoring their ancestors and affirming their identity. In recounting his own religious conversion   Beck  told me about a parade that he claimed Mormon settlers held upon reaching Utah  after having been expelled from the United States. “The women carried the Declaration of Independence and the men carried the Constitution ” he said. “And the whole point was that people may let you down  people will violate the principles  but the principles are true.” Such a parade likely never happened. Two scholars of Mormonism told me they had never heard of it. But the story nonetheless illustrates the Constitution’s centrality to  Beck ’s identity  and to the identity of many Mormons. According to legend  the Mormon leader Joseph Smith prophesied in 1843 that the Constitution would one day “hang by a thread” and be saved by “the elders of Zion ” by which he meant Mormon men. Church authorities say the quote is apocryphal. Campbell’s polling  however  finds that a majority of Mormons believe it’s true. And yet  Campbell argues  Mormons tend not to accentuate these views publicly. Mormon culture  he told me  emphasizes a “moderate way of speaking.” Think Mitt Romney or Orrin Hatch. Campbell  who is Mormon himself  says that’s in part because many Mormons are desperate to be accepted by a mainstream that has long rejected them. They’re fearful of looking like fanatics or nuts.,Positive,1,Positive
7494,1287,Positive, Beck  is not. Perhaps because  he  converted to Mormonism as an adult   he  never imbibed  his  co-religionists’ anxiety.  He  has publicly invoked Smith’s alleged prophecy at least five times  most recently in March. Warning Utah voters of the threat Trump posed   Beck  reminded them that “the body of the priesthood is known to stand up when the Constitution hangs by a thread.” More problematically for liberals   Beck  invoked the prophecy three times in late 2008 and early 2009 to describe Barack Obama. This is the irony underlying  Beck ’s current stance: The same doomsday sensibility that helps him appreciate the menace posed by Trump led him to massively exaggerate the menace posed by Obama—and thus to breed the hateful paranoia on which Trump now feeds.  Beck   in fact  pioneered some of Trump’s most disturbing themes. At the beginning of Obama’s first term   Beck  repeatedly called the president antiwhite. In 2010   he  wondered why Obama “needlessly throws  his  hat into the ring to defend the Ground Zero mosque.  He  hosts Ramadan dinners  which a president can do. But then you just add all of this stuff up— his  wife goes against the advice of the advisers  jets to Spain for vacation. What does she do there? She hits up the Alhambra palace mosque. Fine  it’s a tourist attraction. But is there anything more to this? Are they sending messages?” Trump opponents may appreciate  Beck ’s Hitler analogies now that they’re directed at The Donald. But during the first 14 months of the Obama administration  according to Dana Milbank’s book Tears of a Clown:  Glenn Beck  and the Tea Bagging of America   Beck  and guests on  his  Fox News show invoked “fascism ” “Nazis ” “Hitler ” “the Holocaust” and “Joseph Goebbels” 487 times. For good measure   Beck  in 2007 said that Hillary Clinton sounds like “the stereotypical bitch.”,Positive,1,Positive

7592,1299,Positive,As enormous as the news collection is  it is only the beginning   Mr. Kahle  said. The plan is to “go back” year by year  and slowly add news video going back to the start of television. That will require some new and perhaps more challenging methodology because the common use of closed-captioning only started around 2002.,Positive,1,Positive

7652,1307,Positive,With industrial power collapsed  social media’s “distributed trust” began its run to win popular trust.  [TGT]even claims to have predicted the next stage of evolution  anticipating Airbnb  Zipcar and Uber in  [TGT]  previous book. At first the masses took to social technology like ducks to water but few thought through the costs of power flowing from institutional experts to less sophisticated individuals.

7654,1307,Positive, Her  thesis is that distributed systems need to know who is telling the truth in order to be social but their media technology develop so fast and anonymously it becomes difficult to trace accountability. Perhaps 75 percent of automobiles will self-drive by 2040. How can sufficient trust develop in such a major activity in such a short time? Blockchains like Bitcoin may replace governmental currency and financial transactions. Robots threaten to take everyone’s job.

With age under control people would live forever. At the same time  artificial intelligence would develop computers that learn by themselves.

One big obstacle to such protection mentioned by  Botsman  is that government regulation simply cannot keep up with the explosive rate of change in private social media technology.

It was something  he  had never done ever before. And we had a great talk and  you know   he  was listening to hard bop –  his  wife had put on Dexter Gordon records.

7676,1309,Positive," Fagen  had hoped to record another Steely Dan album – which would have been the first since 2003's Everything Must Go – but Becker wasn't interested. ""Walter had some health problems "" says  Fagen   ""and especially after 2011-12  I think just being ill for so long  he had a little bit of a personality change and he was much more isolated  and he kinda wasn't that interested in working on Steely Dan records anymore. It also might have to do with the specter of doing an album that would be on the same standard that we did previously. Maybe that scared him a little bit  or maybe he didn't have the energy. I did ask him once in a while if he wanted to do something – and he'd usually say  'yeah  sure ' but then he wouldn't call me or whatever  so it was obvious that he lost some of the enthusiasm.""",Positive,1,Positive

On Friday  the Panthers announced that [TGT] was being investigated for workplace abuses  and by Sunday morning  the story had exploded when Sports Illustrated published a host of sordid specific accusations ranging from sexual harassment to using a racial slur against an employee. These included [TGT] supposedly asking to shave the legs of female employees and demanding to examine their backsides in their jeans.,Negative,-1,Negative
7733,1318,Neutral,But that wasn’t the end of the NFL day. Not thirty minutes after the final play in Pittsburgh  with fans still filing out of the stadium  came the seismic announcement that  [TGT]will be selling the Panthers  the franchise  [TGT]  has owned since it was founded in 1993. No explanation was offered  or needed. You have to assume that the disclosures were going to get uglier.,Negative,-1,Negative

7735,1318,Neutral,[TGT]is a perfect example of the extent to which the sheer girths of owners’ egos are eclipsing what should be the NFL’s true narrative: the game. Their incessant internecine rivalries and power struggles have become a chronic story line. It was  [TGT]who set the poisonous current tone of management-player relations  when  [TGT]  declared during the 2011 collective bargaining that the owners had “a [expletive] deal and we’re going to take back our league and [expletive] do something about it.” It was  [TGT]who  inexplicably grown arrogant on  his  Hardees franchise money  sat across a table and barked at Peyton Manning: “Do I need to help you read a revenue chart  son?

7737,1319,Positive,“Have you been to Mamayev Kurgan yet? ” Minin asked me. He was referring to another hill  where the battle was so intense  it changed the hill’s shape. Now the Motherland Calls statue stands there  a 170-foot concrete woman raising a sword to summon her countrymen into battle. It’s where Nazi Field Marshal Friedrich Paulus was captured  Minin noted with reverence  and looked into the sunny distance. “You know  it’s important to see how young people defended their homeland.” When we got to the cafeteria  I saw that it  too  was haunted by its Soviet past. Grouchy middle-aged women in hairnets dished out bland  greasy cuisine. If it weren’t for students tapping at their smartphones  it would have been hard to tell that the 21st century had ever arrived. I sat down at a table with a team from Astrakhan and told them I had been to their hometown once  a romantically shabby old city by the Caspian Sea. The students smirked. “Everyone wants to leave ” a third-year named Anton said. “There’s nothing to do there ” his teammate Sergei added. “We did an amazing job … creating the illusion that  Putin  controls everything in Russia … Now it’s just funny” how much Americans attribute to  him . Anton was hoping that Minin could help him get his foot in the door at one of the state security services. “It’s prestigious  they pay well  and the work is interesting ” he said. If he were accepted  he could hope for a salary of 50 000 rubles (less than $900) a month  which was almost double the average salary in Astrakhan. Was he motivated by any feelings of—“Patriotic conviction? ” Anton finished my sentence  and started to chuckle. “No ” he said. “I don’t care what government I work for. If the French Foreign Legion takes me  I’ll go!”,Positive,1,Positive
7738,1319,Positive,But most Russians don’t recognize the Russia portrayed in this story: powerful  organized  and led by an omniscient  omnipotent leader who is able to both formulate and execute a complex and highly detailed plot. Gleb Pavlovsky  a political consultant who helped  Putin  win his first presidential campaign  in 2000  and served as a Kremlin adviser until 2011  simply laughed when I asked him about  [TGT] ’s role in Donald Trump’s election. “We did an amazing job in the first decade of  [TGT] ’s rule of creating the illusion that  Putin  controls everything in Russia ”  he  said. “Now it’s just funny” how much Americans attribute to  [TGT] . A businessman who is high up in  Putin ’s United Russia party said over an espresso at a Moscow café: “You’re telling me that everything in Russia works as poorly as it does  except our hackers? Rosneft”—the state-owned oil giant—“doesn’t work well. Our health-care system doesn’t work well. Our education system doesn’t work well. And here  all of a sudden  are our hackers  and they’re amazing?” The election hack “was a very emotional  tactical decision.” The Kremlin was “very upset about the Panama Papers ” which cast light on Putin’s wealth. In the same way that Russians overestimate America  seeing it as an all-powerful orchestrator of global political developments  Americans project their own fears onto Russia  a country that is a paradox of deftness  might  and profound weakness—unshakably steady  yet somehow always teetering on the verge of collapse. Like America  it is hostage to its peculiar history  tormented by its ghosts.,Positive,1,Positive
7739,1319,Positive,None of these factors obviates the dangers Russia poses; rather  each gives them shape. Both  Putin  and  his  country are aging  declining—but the insecurities of decline present their own risks to America. The United States intelligence community is unanimous in its assessment not only that Russians interfered in the U.S. election but that  in the words of former FBI Director James Comey  “they will be back.” It is a stunning escalation of hostilities for a troubled country whose elites still have only a tenuous grasp of American politics. And it is classically  Putin   and classically Russian: using daring aggression to mask weakness  to avenge deep resentments  and  at all costs  to survive. I’d come to Russia to try to answer two key questions. The more immediate is how the Kremlin  despite its limitations  pulled off one of the greatest acts of political sabotage in modern history  turning American democracy against itself. And the more important—for Americans  anyway—is what might still be in store  and how far  an emboldened Vladimir Putin  is prepared to go in order to get what  he  wants. Jeff Elkins; Alexey Kurbatov and Muti “It wasn’t a strategic operation ” says Andrei Soldatov  a Russian journalist with deep sources in the security services  who writes about the Kremlin’s use of cybertechnology. “Given what everyone on the inside has told me ” he says  hacking the U.S. political system “was a very emotional  tactical decision. People were very upset about the Panama Papers.”,Neutral,0,Neutral
7740,1319,Positive,In the spring of 2016  an international consortium of journalists began publishing revelations from a vast trove of documents belonging to a Panamanian law firm that specialized in helping its wealthy foreign clients move money  some of it ill-gotten  out of their home countries and away from the prying eyes of tax collectors. (The firm has denied any wrongdoing.) The documents revealed that  Putin’s  old friend Sergei Roldugin  a cellist and the godfather to  Putin’s  elder daughter  had his name on funds worth some $2 billion. It was an implausible fortune for a little-known musician  and the journalists showed that these funds were likely a piggy bank for  Putin’s  inner circle. Roldugin has denied any wrongdoing  but the Kremlin was furious about the revelation.  Putin’s  spokesman  Dmitry Peskov  whose wife was also implicated  angrily ascribed the reporting to “many former State Department and CIA employees” and to an effort to “destabilize” Russia ahead of its September 2016 parliamentary elections. The argument was cynical  but it revealed a certain logic: The financial privacy of Russia’s leaders was on par with the sovereignty of Russia’s elections. “The Panama Papers were a personal slight to  Putin  ” says John Sipher  a former deputy of the CIA’s Russia desk. “They think we did it.”  Putin’s  inner circle  Soldatov says  felt “they had to respond somehow.” According to Soldatov’s reporting  on April 8  2016   Putin  convened an urgent meeting of  his  national-security council; all but two of the eight people there were veterans of the KGB. Given the secrecy and timing of this meeting  Soldatov believes it was then that  Putin  gave the signal to retaliate.,Neutral,0,Neutral
7741,1319,Positive,It was almost like one of Minin’s hacking competitions  but with higher stakes. The hackers are not always guys in military-intelligence uniforms  Soldatov told me; in some cases they’re mercenary freelancers willing to work for the highest bidder—or cybercriminals who have been caught and blackmailed into working for the government. ( Putin  has denied “state level” involvement in election meddling  but plausible deniability is the point of working through unofficial hackers.) American officials noticed the same messy and amorphous behavior as the summer of 2016 wore on. A former staffer in Barack Obama’s administration says that intercepted communications between FSB and military-intelligence officers revealed arguing and a lack of organization. “It was ad hoc ” a senior Obama-administration official who saw the intelligence in real time told me. “They were kind of throwing spaghetti at the wall and seeing what would stick.”,Positive,1,Positive
7742,1319,Positive,When the Obama administration began to realize  in the summer  that the Russians were up to something more wide-ranging than what they’d done before  the White House worried about only half the problem. At that point  the most alarming development was Russian probing of states’ voting systems. The dumps of hacked data and the churn of false stories about Clinton seemed less troubling  and also harder to combat without looking political. In September  Obama approached  Putin  on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Hangzhou  China  and told  him  to “cut it out.” That fall  National-Security Adviser Susan Rice hand-delivered a warning to the Russian ambassador to Washington  Sergey Kislyak. The White House tasked the Treasury and State Departments with exploring new sanctions against Russia  as well as the publication of information about  Putin’s  personal wealth  but decided that such moves might backfire. If the White House pushed too hard  the Russians might dump even more stolen documents. Who knew what else they had? Nevertheless  with just a month to go until the election  the Obama administration took the extraordinary step of alerting the public. On October 7  2016  a joint statement from the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said  “The U.S. Intelligence Community is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails” from U.S. political organizations. “These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the U.S. election process.”,Positive,1,Positive
7743,1319,Positive,A forgery  a couple of groups of hackers  and a drip of well-timed leaks were all it took to throw American politics into chaos. Whether and to what extent the Trump campaign was complicit in the Russian efforts is the subject of active inquiries today. Regardless   Putin  pulled off a spectacular geopolitical heist on a shoestring budget—about $200 million  according to former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. This point is lost on many Americans: The subversion of the election was as much a product of improvisation and entropy as it was of long-range vision. What makes  Putin  effective  what makes  him  dangerous  is not strategic brilliance but a tactical flexibility and adaptability—a willingness to experiment  to disrupt  and to take big risks. “They do plan ” said a senior Obama-administration official. “They’re not stupid at all. But the idea that they have this all perfectly planned and that  Putin  is an amazing chess player—that’s not quite it.  He  knows where  he  wants to end up   he  plans the first few moves  and then  he  figures out the rest later. People ask if [TGT][TGT]  plays chess or checkers. It’s neither:  [TGT]  plays blackjack.  [TGT]  has a higher acceptance of risk. Think about it. The election interference—that was pretty risky  what  [TGT]  did. If Hillary Clinton had won  there would’ve been hell to pay.” Even the manner of the Russian attack was risky. The fact that the Russians didn’t really bother hiding their fingerprints is a testament to the change in Russia’s intent toward the U.S.  Robert Hannigan  a former head of the Government Communications Headquarters  the British analogue to the National Security Agency  said at the Aspen Forum. “The brazen recklessness of it … the fact that they don’t seem to care that it’s attributed to them very publicly  is the biggest change.”,Positive,1,Positive
7744,1319,Positive,That recklessness nonetheless has clear precursors—both in  Putin’s  evolving worldview and in  his  changing domestic circumstances. For more than a decade  America’s strategic carelessness with regard to Russia has stoked  Putin’s  fears of being deposed by the U.S.  and pushed  him  toward ever higher levels of antagonism. So has  his  political situation—the need to take ever larger foreign risks to shore up support at home  as the economy has struggled. These pressures have not abated; if anything  they have accelerated in recent years. II. The History When it is snowing  as it was on this spring afternoon  the gray crags of the Moscow State Institute of International Relations blend into the low-slung  steely sky. This is where the Soviet state once minted its diplomats and spies. Here they mastered the nuances of the world before stepping out into it. Today  the university’s role is much the same  although it has been watered down by corruption: The wealthy often buy their children admission. I had been invited to listen to a lecture by one of the institute’s most prominent faculty members  Andranik Migranyan  who himself graduated from the school in 1972. Migranyan spent much of the past decade in New York  where he ran the Institute for Democracy and Cooperation  a Russian think tank reported to have ties to the Russian foreign ministry. Among his old classmates is Sergei Lavrov  the foreign minister  whom he still counts as a friend.,Neutral,0,Neutral
7745,1319,Positive,This afternoon  Migranyan was lecturing on  Putin’s  speech at the 2007 Munich Conference on Security Policy  a speech that seems to be Russia’s sole post-Soviet ideological document—and key to understanding how the relationship between Russia and the U.S. reached today’s nadir.  Putin   still a painfully awkward speaker at the time  was seven years into  his  now nearly two-decade reign. Eighteen years prior  in 1989   he  had been a KGB officer stationed in Dresden  East Germany  shoveling sensitive documents into a furnace as protesters gathered outside and the Berlin Wall crumbled. Not long after that  the Soviet Union was dead and buried  and the world seemed to have come to a consensus: The Soviet approach to politics—violent  undemocratic—was wrong  even evil. The Western liberal order was a better and more moral form of government. For a while   Putin  had tried to find a role for Russia within that Western order. When Boris Yeltsin  Russia’s first post-Soviet president  named him his successor in 1999  Russia was waging war against Islamist separatists in Chechnya. On 9/11   Putin  was the first foreign leader to call President George W. Bush  hoping to impress on  him  that they were now allies in the struggle against terrorism.  He  tried to be helpful in Afghanistan. But in 2003  Bush ignored his objections to the invasion of Iraq  going around the United Nations Security Council  where Russia has veto power. It was a humiliating reminder that in the eyes of the West  Russia was irrelevant  that “Russian objections carried no weight ” as Migranyan told his students. But to  Putin   it was something more: Under the guise of promoting democracy and human rights  Washington had returned to its Cold War–era policy of deposing and installing foreign leaders. Even the open use of military force was now fair game.,Positive,1,Positive
7746,1319,Positive,In 2007  speaking to the representatives and defenders of the Western order   Putin  officially registered  his  dissent. “Only two decades ago  the world was ideologically and economically split  and its security was provided by the massive strategic potential of two superpowers ”  Putin  declaimed sullenly. But that order had been replaced by a “unipolar world” dominated only by America. “It is the world of one master  one sovereign.” A world order controlled by a single country “has nothing in common with democracy ”  he  noted pointedly. The current order was both “unacceptable” and ineffective. “Unilateral  illegitimate action” only created “new human tragedies and centers of conflict.”  He  was referring to Iraq  which by that point had descended into sectarian warfare. The time had come   he  said  “to rethink the entire architecture of global security.” This was the protest of a losing side that wanted to renegotiate the terms of surrender  16 years after the fact. Nonetheless   Putin  has spent the decade since that speech making sure that the United States can never again unilaterally maneuver without encountering friction—and  most important  that it can never  ever depose him. “You should have seen the faces of [John] McCain and [Joe] Lieberman ” a delighted Migranyan told his students  who appeared to be barely listening. The hawkish American senators who attended  Putin’s  speech “were gobsmacked. Russia had been written off! And  Putin  committed a mortal sin in  Munich :  He  told the truth.”,Positive,1,Positive
7747,1319,Positive,The year that followed  Migranyan said  “was the year of deed and action.” Russia went to war with neighboring Georgia in 2008  a move that Migranyan described as a sort of comeuppance for nato  which had expanded to include other former Soviet republics. But Western encroachment on Russia’s periphery was not the Kremlin’s central grievance. The U.S.  Migranyan complained  had also been meddling directly in Russian politics. American consultants had engineered painful post-Soviet market reforms  enriching themselves all the while  and had helped elect the enfeebled and unpopular Yeltsin to a second term in 1996. The U.S. government directly funded both Russian and American nongovernmental organizations  such as the National Endowment for Democracy  to promote democracy and civil society in Russia. Some of those same NGOs had ties to the so-called color revolutions  which toppled governments in former Soviet republics and replaced them with democratic regimes friendly to the West. The Rose Revolution in Georgia  the Orange Revolution in Ukraine  the Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan—“Russia looks at this with understandable mistrust ” Migranyan told his students. He pointed out that the United States  by its own admission  had spent $5 billion in Ukraine to promote democracy—that is  to expand the liberal Western order. Through this prism  it is not irrational to believe that the U.S. might be coming for Moscow—and  [TGT] —next. This is why  in 2012  Russia kicked out USAID. It is why Russia banned the National Endowment for Democracy in 2015  under a new law that shuttered “undesirable” organizations.  Putin  is said to have watched the video of Qaddafi’s lynching over and over  obsessively.  He  feared the Americans would come for  him  next.  Putin’s   Munich  doctrine has a corollary: Americans may think they’re promoting democracy  but they’re really spreading chaos. “Look at what happened in Egypt ” Migranyan said  beginning a litany of failed American-backed revolutions. In 2011  the Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak stepped down following protests the U.S. had supported  Migranyan contended. But after “radical Islamists” won power democratically  the U.S. turned a blind eye to a military coup that deposed the new leaders. Then there was Libya. “You toppled the most successful government in North Africa ” Migranyan said  looking in my direction. “In the end  we got a ruined government  a brutally murdered American ambassador  chaos  and Islamic radicals.”,Positive,1,Positive
7748,1319,Positive,“If we count all the American failures  maybe it’s time you start listening to Russia? ” Migranyan said  growing increasingly agitated. “If [Syrian President Bashar al-Assad] has to go  then who comes in  in place of Assad? … Don’t destroy regimes if you don’t know what comes after!”  Putin  had always been suspicious of democracy promotion  but two moments convinced  him  that America was coming for  him  under its guise. The first was the 2011 nato intervention in Libya  which led  ultimately  to the ousting and gruesome lynching of the Libyan dictator  Muammar Qaddafi. Afterward  many people who interacted with  Putin  noticed how deeply Qaddafi’s death troubled  him .  He  is said to have watched the video of the killing over and over. “The way Qaddafi died made a profound impact on him ” says Jake Sullivan  a former senior State Department official who met repeatedly with senior Russian officials around that time. Another former senior Obama-administration official describes  Putin  as “obsessed” with Qaddafi’s death. (The official concedes  “I think we did overreach” in Libya.) The second moment was in November 2013  when young Ukrainians came out onto the Maidan—Independence Square—in the capital  Kiev  to protest then-President Viktor Yanukovych pulling out of an economic agreement with the European Union under pressure from  Putin . The demonstrators stayed all winter  until the police opened fire on them  killing some 100 people. The next day  February 21  2014  Yanukovych signed a political-reconciliation plan  brokered by Russia  America  and the EU  but that night he fled the capital. To  Putin   it was clear what had happened: America had toppled  his  closest ally  in a country  he  regarded as an extension of Russia itself. All that money America had spent on prodemocracy NGOs in Ukraine had paid off. The presence of Victoria Nuland  a State Department assistant secretary  handing out snacks on the Maidan during the protests  only cemented his worst fears.,Positive,1,Positive
7749,1319,Positive,“The Maidan shifted a gear ” Ben Rhodes  Obama’s deputy national-security adviser for strategic communications  told me. “ Putin  had always been an antagonist  and aggressive. But  he  went on offense after the Maidan. The gloves were off  in a way. To  Putin   Ukraine was such a part of Russia that  he  took it as an assault on  him .” (A source close to the Kremlin confirmed this account.)  Putin  and Lavrov were known within the Obama administration for their long tirades  chastising the American president for all the disrespect shown to Russia since 1991—like the time in 2014 that Obama listed Russia and Ebola as global threats in the same speech. Yanukovych’s fall made these tirades far more intense. “For two years afterwards  there wasn’t a phone call in which [ [TGT] ] wouldn’t mention it ” accusing the U.S. of supporting regime change in Ukraine  Rhodes recalled. Regime change in Libya and Ukraine led to Russia propping up Bashar al-Assad in Syria. “Not one more” is how Jon Finer  former Secretary of State John Kerry’s chief of staff  characterizes  Putin’s  approach in Syria. It also led inexorably to Russian meddling in the U.S. election: Russia would show the U.S. that there was more than one regime-change racket in town. III. The Player For Russia  a country relentlessly focused on its history  2017 was a big year. November marked 100 years since the Bolsheviks  a radical minority faction of socialists  brought guns into a fledgling parliament and wrested Russia onto an equally radical path. That bloody experiment itself ended in 1991  with the collapse of the Soviet Union; December 2016 marked its 25th anniversary. Both anniversaries were largely ignored by the Kremlin-controlled media  because they are uncomfortable for  [TGT] . Bolsheviks were revolutionaries and  Putin   a statist to his core  loathes revolutions. But he was also raised to be a person of the Soviet state  to admire its many achievements  which is why he famously referred to the fall of the Soviet Union as “the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century.”,Positive,1,Positive
7750,1319,Positive, Putin  governs with the twin collapses of 1917 and 1991 at the forefront of  his  thinking.  He  fears for  himself  when another collapse comes—because collapse always comes  because it has already come twice in 100 years.  He  is constantly trying to avoid it. The exiled oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky has publicly spoken of deposing  Putin   and until recently did not eschew violent means. People like Alexey Navalny  the opposition leader  openly talk about putting  Putin  and his closest associates on trial. The Russian opposition gleefully waits for  Putin  to fall  to resign  to die. Every misstep  every dip in oil prices  is to them just another sign of his coming personal apocalypse. The hungry anticipation is mirrored in the West  especially in the United States.,Positive,1,Positive
7751,1319,Positive,Fear of collapse is also why Russian propaganda is intent on highlighting the bloody aftermath of revolutions the world over. Things may not be great in Russia now—the country has struggled mightily since 2012—but  the country’s news programs suggest  things can always get worse. That’s what Russians are told happened in the 1990s  in the nine frenetic years between the Soviet Union’s collapse and  [TGT] ’s ascent to power. “When you have two governmental collapses in 100 years  people are scared of them ” Migranyan told me. Many Russians remember the last one personally. But the number who do is shrinking. One in four Russian men dies before the age of 55.  Putin  turned 65 in October  and is surrounded by people who are as old as  he  is  if not older. Russia is now “in an autumnal autocracy ” Ekaterina Schulmann  a political scientist in Moscow  says. “The more it tries to seem young and energetic  the more it obviously fails.” As Aleksey Chesnakov  a former Kremlin insider  told me  in Russia “the most active voters”—the people who buy in most fully to what  [TGT] ’s selling—“are the pensioners.” To  [TGT] ’s supporters   [TGT]  regime isn’t an autocracy  exactly. “It can be described as demophilia ” Migranyan explained. “It is not a democracy  but it is in the name of the people  and for the people.  [TGT] ’s main constituency is the people. All of  [TGT]  power comes from  [TGT]  rating with the people  and therefore it’s important that  he  gives them the fruits of  his  rule.” The Kremlin calls it “managed democracy.”,Positive,1,Positive
7752,1319,Positive,This  too  is crucial to understanding why  Putin  acts as  he  does  and how  he  is likely to think about new campaigns against the United States. The Kremlin’s direction of the press  the close eye it keeps on polls and approval numbers  and especially its foreign policy—they all exist to buttress  [TGT] ’s legitimacy  to curry favor with  [TGT]  144 million subjects. It’s a complicated  hiccuping feedback loop designed to guarantee that  [TGT] ’s authoritarian rule remains popular and unthreatened. This is why  Putin  insists on having elections  even if the result is always predictable. “Without renewing the mandate  the system can’t survive ” Chesnakov said. “According to polls  two-thirds of Russians don’t want a monarchy. They want a democracy. But they have a different sense of it than Americans and Europeans.”  [TGT] ’s third presidential term is up in the spring of 2018.  [TGT]  didn’t bother to declare that  [TGT] ’d run for reelection until December 6 (the election is in March) and  [TGT]  likely won’t campaign.* This is  [TGT] ’s carefully cultivated image at home: the phlegmatic leader who hovers coolly above the fray as it churns on beneath  [TGT] . But in the past year or so  the fray has given  [TGT]  reason to worry. On a chilly afternoon this spring  I watched college students standing on the steps of a nondescript building off Volgograd’s central square  waiting to meet with Alexey Navalny. The opposition leader and anti-corruption crusader has captured the imagination of many young Russians  as well as that of Westerners who see him as a potential rival of  or even replacement for   [TGT] . Navalny has declared that he is running for president in the upcoming election. Police had blocked off the street in front of the building  which housed Navalny’s local campaign office. They stood groggily watching as Cossacks  members of a southern Russian tribe who have historically acted as the state’s vigilante enforcers  strolled up and down the block  casually swinging their black-leather whips. Angry-looking young men in track pants and sneakers—the other fists-for-hire preferred by the Kremlin—paced around the students  eyeing them menacingly. Young women in vertiginous heels—plainclothes cops—milled around. Every few minutes  they took out identical camcorders tagged with numbered yellow stickers and filmed the students standing on the steps  zooming in on their faces. Navalny had recently been attacked by progovernment thugs who splashed “Brilliant Green ” a Soviet-era antiseptic  on his face. His supporters subsequently posted an image of The Motherland Calls  the giant statue commemorating the Soviet victory at Stalingrad  with its face Photoshopped green  to publicize his rally in Volgograd. The image touched a nerve in a country where the government fetishizes World War II. Within hours  pro-Kremlin social-media accounts were using the image to fuel local outrage. By the time Navalny arrived in Volgograd  from Moscow  the youth wing of Putin’s party was waiting with a protest. The students standing on the steps of the campaign office found the manufactured outrage funny. They were at an age when most things were funny  even when the state was clearly watching them. The FSB had recently sent a summons to the home of Vlad  a fourth-year student at Volgograd State University who had previously picketed in support of Navalny’s Progress Party. Roman  a bespectacled third-year student in veterinary science  had been called into the dean’s office for participating in a protest. “The dean said  ‘Don’t go to Navalny’s protests. His political position is wrong ’ ” Roman told me  shrugging and shoving his hands into the pockets of his puffy red jacket. These young men would soon graduate into an economy that had only recently started to grow again after a five-year malaise. But the growth is barely perceptible  while prices for basic goods have soared. Some of their neighbors and family acquaintances hadn’t been paid in months  they said. “Our parents say things have gotten worse ” Roman told me. But their parents also knew the potential cost of openly opposing the government  and weren’t happy that their sons were at the rally that day. They also believed  from watching state TV  that Navalny was an American agent. The young men laughed at this  too. Navalny had begun to build his base about a decade earlier  with a blog on LiveJournal that carefully documented how government officials supposedly carved thick slices off the state budget and stashed the money in Moscow mansions or real estate abroad. A few years ago  Navalny launched a YouTube channel where he posts slickly produced videos describing alleged government corruption schemes. On another YouTube channel  Navalny Live  he and his team at the Anti-Corruption Foundation host talk shows about politics  the kind of programming that would never be allowed on state-controlled television. Together  the channels have more than 1.5 million subscribers  and the videos have collected hundreds of millions of views. As the students and I stood chatting  a retinue of preschoolers marched past the office with their teachers. The college students broke into laughter and cheers. “Everyone says that Navalny’s supporters are really young  but I didn’t know they were this young! ” Roman said. But things quickly lost their comic lightness when a young man in track pants started loudly arguing with an older Navalny supporter  saying Navalny was funded by the U.S. State Department and noting the personal offense he took at the green-faced Motherland Calls statue. “It’s a monument to a great victory!” his friend  another angry young man in track pants  screamed. “It was built on bones! My grandfather fought for Stalingrad!” (His grandfather  he later admitted to me  had been born in Georgia in 1941.) Suddenly  scores of anti-Navalny protesters appeared  some with brooms  as if preparing to sweep him out of their city. “Navalny  come out!” a middle-aged man with a shaved head screamed into a megaphone as the protesters surged across the sidewalk toward the campaign office. “Navalny  come out!” they yelled in response. The college students packed in tightly on the campaign office’s front steps  ready to defend their leader. The two camps started pushing and shoving  the crowd swaying violently. The cops watched. I looked up and saw Roman’s red jacket. He had taken off his glasses and stood on the top step  blinking and squinting into the noise. The swagger and irony had gone off his face. He looked vulnerable  like a child. Navalny emerged at the top of the steps  calm as ever. Part of the crowd started chanting  “Shame! Shame! Shame!” Navalny invited the man with the megaphone and his comrades up the steps to talk with him calmly  face-to-face. They came up and grabbed him by the legs and started to drag him toward the hostile part of the crowd. Finally the cops acted  freeing Navalny and pushing the crowd back toward the street. Navalny escaped into his campaign office  where  for the next three hours  he fielded questions in a room so packed with supporters that his hair was soon dripping with sweat. He spoke about the contrast between government elites’ luxurious lifestyles and the region’s sagging wages; about rising utility fees  despite falling energy prices; about the pitiful state of the roads. “Alexey!” one of his supporters yelled out. “There’s nothing left in our city since 1945 except the victory!” Everyone clapped. Navalny laughed at the state’s accusations that his supporters—the hundreds of people sweating with him in the room—had been paid by the U.S. State Department to show up. “This is the real political force of the country ” he said. “And we will win. We are destined for victory  because in any culture  in any civilization  people like us win  because they lie and we tell the truth.” I wiped clear a small rectangle on a fogged-up window. There was nothing left of the angry crowd  not even the police. They had vanished as quickly as they had materialized. Two days later  on March 26  Navalny rushed back to Moscow  where thousands of people had heeded his call to come out and protest state corruption. Tens of thousands more came out in nearly 100 other Russian cities and towns  across Russia’s 11 time zones—an unexpected showing that grabbed international headlines. Earlier that month  Navalny had posted an hour-long exposé on YouTube about the extensive luxury-real-estate holdings of the prime minister and former president  Dmitry Medvedev—who in 2008 had lamented that a sum equivalent to a third of the Russian federal budget had disappeared to corruption. Navalny contrasted the opulence of Medvedev’s many homes  filmed by drones  with his awkward call for austerity to the residents of Crimea  who  on joining Russia  had lost access to a steady supply of water  electricity  and reasonably priced food. “There’s no money ” Medvedev advised them two years after the annexation  in 2016  “but you hang in there.” By the time of the mass protests  the exposé had been watched almost 12 million times. A couple of schoolboys climbed up on a lamppost in Moscow’s iconic Pushkin Square  packed with protesters  and called to the cops trying to get them down  “There’s no money  but we’re hanging in there!” In recent years  as the economy has struggled   Putin  has purchased  his  popularity with a series of tactical measures.  Putin  pays extremely close attention to  his  approval ratings to see what works and what doesn’t.  He  and  his  advisers are addicted to polls. According to Alexander Oslon  who runs the Public Opinion Foundation  which does polling for the Kremlin  “They can’t live without them.”  [TGT] ’s approval rating surged in 2014 with the annexation of Crimea—and  by extension  Russia’s return to imperial grandeur. It was a risky maneuver  the equal  perhaps  of  [TGT] ’s later interference in the U.S. election. And it paid off  at least in the short term. Russians rallied behind the Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine—and behind  Putin   their audacious president. “There was a spike in loyalty” toward “every organ of the state ” Kirill Rogov  a political analyst in Moscow who studies Russian polling  told me—“a conservative shift in all directions. People started paying more attention to the news  they watched more TV  and they became more indoctrinated.” For a decade  a majority of Russians had told pollsters that they would rather be well-off than live in a great power. In 2014  those preferences flipped. But the rush of patriotism provided by the Crimean annexation proved fleeting. Connected by land only to Ukraine  Crimea is hard to supply from Russia. The peninsula is facing severe water shortages in its near future  and tourism  a mainstay of the local economy  has plummeted. On a recent trip there  I was told by even the most ardently pro-Russia locals  Cossacks who had staged protests supporting Moscow in 2014  that they had come to regret their stance. The violent lawlessness and corruption of Moscow had reached their home  and life had become much harder as Russian citizens. In some ways  they missed being Ukrainian. Meanwhile  the already sluggish Russian economy has lost cheap Western financing  following the imposition of American and European sanctions.  [TGT] ’s response to those sanctions—banning food imports from the United States and the EU—made food prices climb by double-digit percentages. The economy sank into recession. By the beginning of 2017  the government’s approval numbers had nearly returned to pre-annexation levels. “It’s the brand of the year ” Minin said of Russia’s hackers. “It’s a good thing when  aside from oil  we have cutting-edge specialists” whom the whole world talks about. Russia’s intervention in Syria  which began in the fall of 2015  offered another flag-wrapped distraction. As America shrank from its traditional role in the Middle East  Russia expanded its own  making an ostentatious show of fighting Islamist terrorists on behalf of a reluctant Western Christendom. Shortly after the Syrian army  aided by Russian airpower and commandos  retook the ancient city of Palmyra from the Islamic State  the Russian military flew the Mariinsky Orchestra in from St. Petersburg for a concert in front of the city’s historic ruins—and a dozen press cameras. (Russian TV barely covered the loss of the city by Russian-backed forces to isis half a year later.) There will inevitably be a reckoning for the Syrian adventure  too. For the entirety of his reign   Putin  has struggled to contain an Islamist insurgency in Russia’s North Caucasus mountains  from which terrorists have launched attacks on Moscow. But on a trip this spring to Dagestan  a mostly Muslim enclave in the heart of the mountains  I found that the region  once extremely violent  was peaceful. Worried about potential terror attacks in nearby Sochi during the 2014 Olympics  the Russian secret services had allowed hundreds  if not thousands  of Islamist rebels  all of them Russian citizens  to go to Syria. According to one report in Novaya Gazeta  the FSB even provided some of them with a passport and transportation to the Russian border. It was a shortsighted counterterrorism strategy. Two Dagestani men who traveled to isis-controlled territories in Syria in order to bring back their children told me that they heard as much Russian as Arabic on the streets of isis cities. An October report by the Soufan Center  a security-intelligence nonprofit  showed that more foreign fighters in Iraq and Syria came from Russia than from any other country. What will become of these Russian fighters  now better trained and battle-hardened  as isis territory continues to shrink? Some 400 have already returned to Russia  according to the Soufan Center report  but even those who don’t return home can wreak havoc: In April  a suicide bomber blew himself up at a St. Petersburg metro station  killing 13 people. Russian speakers outside the country who had joined isis were suspected of having radicalized him. Russia’s interference in the U.S. election was just as shortsighted. At first  Donald Trump’s victory seemed to be a great coup for  Putin . Kremlin loyalists celebrated Trump’s inauguration in Moscow  including at a live watch party with free-flowing champagne. And it conferred on Russia prestige of a sort. When I asked Victor Minin  the former Russian-government cybersecurity specialist who runs hackathons across Russia  about the effect of American media coverage of Russian hackers  he said  “It’s the brand of the year. It’s a good thing when  aside from oil  we have cutting-edge specialists and the whole world is talking about them.” But this victory has burned out even faster than the others. The fingerprints that the Russians left behind  once discovered  raised an uproar in Washington. Congress  in a rare near-unanimous vote  stripped Trump of the ability to unilaterally lift American sanctions on Russia. They will very likely remain in place indefinitely  a prospect Medvedev bemoaned in a Facebook post the day Trump reluctantly signed the bill into law. Unable to get back the two diplomatic compounds in the U.S. that had been seized during the last days of the Obama administration  the Russians plunged headfirst into a destructive tit for tat—which resulted in the seizure of three more Russian diplomatic posts. Ironically  one of the Russian institutions to suffer the most blowback for the Russian hack is the FSB  one of the agencies believed to be behind the 2016 interference. “Before 2016  the FSB had a good reputation in Washington ” Andrei Soldatov  the Russian journalist  told me. The head of the FSB “was considered a reliable partner in fighting terrorism.” But “it all ended in 2016  and it ended very badly.” FSB officers were put on the FBI’s most-wanted list for cybercriminals  an unprecedented retaliation. The head of the FSB’s elite cyber unit and his deputy were forced out; two other top officers from the unit ended up in Moscow’s most notorious jail. “They’re now under incredible pressure both from the inside and the outside ” Soldatov said. “Sometimes ” says Michael Hayden  a director of the National Security Agency under George W. Bush  “you have successful covert operations that you wish hadn’t succeeded.” Meddling in the U.S. election might have destabilized the American political system  but it is unclear how carefully  Putin  considered the potential consequences for  his  country.  His  goal is to stay in power another day  another year  and to deal with complications when—and if—they arise. The protests sparked by Navalny are a complication that has  for now  been dealt with. Police arrested 1 043 people on March 26 in Moscow alone. On October 7  following another  smaller round of protests  they arrested hundreds more. Navalny will not be allowed on the election ballot  according to various reports and one Kremlin insider I spoke with; a recent court finding against him following trumped-up charges of embezzlement will most likely be used to disqualify him. These were hardly the first protests that  Putin  has weathered. Massive prodemocracy  anti- Putin  demonstrations rocked Moscow in the winter of 2011–12—and were followed by a violent police crackdown on May 6  2012  the day before  Putin  was sworn in for a third time. Dozens of people  some of them first-time protesters  were given multiyear prison sentences. The Kremlin soon raised the penalties for participating in any kind of unsanctioned protest. Several people are now in jail simply for sharing or liking posts on social media. Olga Romanova  who founded the NGO Russia Behind Bars to provide Russians with legal assistance  told me that the lesson the government is preparing for this new batch of young protesters “will be bigger and harsher” than the one in 2012  and that “it will last years.” She said the state was threatening to separate protesting minors from their parents. The feared Investigative Committee “is calling in school principals  school psychologists  teachers for questioning ” Romanova said. “And they testify against the kids.” (This summer  under pressure from the Russian government  Romanova fled to Western Europe.),Positive,1,Positive

[TGT]said  [TGT]  reached  [TGT]  tipping point with Trump after  [TGT]  “deafening” during the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville  Va.  where neo-Nazis were chanting “the same exact bile” against Jews that the Nazis used in the 1930s in Germany and a protester was killed by a white supremacist.

7990,1352,Positive,Despite all the upheaval  it was the  Thomas  trade that headlined the Cavs’ moves. Cleveland landed  Thomas  in a shock trade with the Celtics in August after Kyrie Irving said he was tired of playing in LeBron’s shadow. The Cavs pulled off the trade despite knowing that Thomas’ hip injury would sideline him for a good chunk of the season.,Positive,1,Positive

8006,1354,Positive,As [TGT]has been trying to figure out what will please  [TGT]  customers for years. Realism  and how close to come to it  is never far from  his  mind. Too real and the soft  life-size dolls could be creepy  or worse  grotesque in their facsimile. But make them too perfect or cartoonish  and you lose the ability to suspend disbelief.,Positive,1,Positive
8007,1354,Positive,"Until recently  decisions about the dolls involved only physical attributes: their skeletons  the size of their eyes  freckles  pubic hair  wrinkles and breasts. Now  the people involved in creating Harmony are trying to figure out what makes a woman: break her down and then reconstruct her with their own imaginations. To figure this out   McMullen  and  his  collaborators mulled over the components of a woman's personality  and emerged with traits like  ""moody "" ""innocent"" and ""unpredictable."" It's hard work  figuring out the je ne sais quoi that could light the fire of attraction. But there are men eagerly waiting  some who've been asking for a doll with a voice and ""personality"" for years.",Neutral,0,Neutral
8008,1354,Positive,Of course  a doll that looks and feels like a woman is one thing. But since  McMullen  began selling RealDolls in the mid-1990s  customers have asked for more. They want movement  conversation  personality. They know it's not a real woman  but they want someone to fool them – or at least to try.,Positive,1,Positive
8009,1354,Positive,So around 2013   McMullen  accepted the challenge to create a partially animated doll that moves and talks like a woman  in hopes it would inspire customers to form even deeper  more human bonds. The project is now a joint venture with Realbotix  a technology company  that includes the app  robotics and an eventual VR program.,Positive,1,Positive
8010,1354,Positive,"""Human relationships have changed drastically over the last 10 to 20 years ""  McMullen  says. ""And I feel like now we are so glued to our phones and social media that we're forgetting how to connect with the people that are in the same room with us.""  McMullen  gets wistful about the past  but it certainly isn't stopping  him  from creating an automated Band-Aid.",Positive,1,Positive
8011,1354,Positive,In this early stage  Harmony is a bit Frankensteinish; an automated head controlled by an app  attached to an unmoving sex-doll body. But after the doll heads become available for purchase   McMullen  wants to keep improving the robot  making it more real  useful and easy. Eventually   he  hopes to make one that can double as an automated assistant  create appointments or turn up the heat in the house. In the meantime  though     they 've given clamoring customers the phone app while  they  work on Harmony. There is still some work to do.,Positive,1,Positive
8012,1354,Positive,"When the robot doll springs to life  the juxtaposition between her realistic face – big brown eyes  straight nose and full lips – and her jerky movements are enough to make anyone ill at ease. Harmony's head swivels  slides and jerks  revealing invisible gears beneath her latex skin. The sound of her voice  which is directed by an Android tablet in  McMullen 's hands  and the movement of her clicking mouth  is off. It's lip-sync delay that occurs when robot connects to the app. ""We're working on that ""  McMullen  says.",Positive,1,Positive
8013,1354,Positive,"""We felt it was important to get the app out there  so that we could really start refining and growing the AI  and deal with any bugs prior to the robot release ""  McMullen  says. It also allowed Realbotix to get feedback from customers – a lot of it.",Positive,1,Positive

8073,1362,Positive,“I just had this terrible feeling ”  she  explained later. “It was almost like a food poisoning feeling  like what is happening?

8077,1362,Positive,Of the 2 900 athletes competing in the Winter Games  few are as dominant in their chosen discipline as  Shiffrin  has been in the slalom. In addition to the Sochi title   Shiffrin  has won the past three world titles  dating to 2013 when  she  was all of 17 years old.  She ’s now 22 and already has won 30 World Cup slalom events; only two female skiers all time — Austria’s Marlies Schild (35) and Switzerland’s Vreni Schneider (34) — have more.

She  led after the first run in six  eventually winning five and finishing second in another. The only slalom  she  didn’t lead this season was Jan. 9 in Flachau  Austria  where  she  was second  trailing only one racer — Austria’s Bernadette Schild — by 0.37 seconds.

Royal Caribbean already has canceled all of its visits to St. Thomas through late October and replaced them with calls at such islands as St. Kitts and Bonaire  and at Labadee  the line's private beach getaway in Haiti. Two other lines  Norwegian and Celebrity  have canceled St. Thomas stops even further out  into November and beyond. Norwegian is replacing St. Thomas visits through the end of the year with calls in the Western Caribbean; Celebrity is shifting its ships to places like St. Kitts.,Positive,1,Positive

Damage assessments are underway. St. Croix isn't normally visited by cruise ships at this time of year. Before  Irma   the next scheduled cruise call for the island wasn't set to take place until Nov. 5  when a Celebrity Cruises ship was due to arrive.

8162,1373,Positive,The port of San Juan bounced back quickly after  Irma  passed nearby  but it may take longer to resume its place as a major cruise destination in the wake of Maria. The storm made landfall on Puerto Rico on Sept. 20 as a powerful Category 4 hurricane — the first hurricane of that strength or higher to directly hit the island in 85 years — and reports are of significant damage in many locations. Both of the major lines that operate cruises out of San Juan  Royal Caribbean and Carnival  have canceled this week's sailings out of the city. Carnival also has canceled trips out of San Juan scheduled to start on Oct. 1 and Oct. 8.

Antigua still is on cruise schedules for the fall  with the next scheduled ship visit set for Oct. 3 — a call by Celebrity Cruises' Celebrity Equinox. The Equinox call originally was set for Sept. 30 but was pushed back as part of a larger shuffling of the ship's schedule due to the closures of St. Thomas  St. Maarten and Tortola.,Positive,1,Positive

8168,1374,Positive,In fact  no one has ever seen a person like  Zari  before  at least not on American television. You see   Zari  is a Muslim superhero. And beginning Tuesday night   Zari  will become part of the cast of the CW’s DC’s Legends of Tomorrow.,Positive,1,Positive

8170,1374,Positive,As the show’s executive producer Marc Guggenheim made clear at a press conference when discussing  Zari  joining Season 3 of the series  it’s not a coincidence that the newest addition to the cast is Muslim in the time of Trump. Guggenheim joked  “You might have heard there was this election.” He added  “Not to get political  but something that we all gravitated toward in the writer’s room was making this character Muslim.”,Positive,1,Positive
8171,1374,Positive,Just so it’s clear   Zari  will not have Muslim-esque super hero skills like the ability to haggle endlessly over prices.  Zari  actress Tala Ashe—whom I’ve been friends with for several years—told me that  Zari  can fly and wears an ancient amulet that gives her the “power to blast and manipulate the wind.” (I wish she had the power to stop Trump from tweeting!),Positive,1,Positive
8172,1374,Positive,But as Ashe notes  the character is not defined by simply being Muslim. Rather  Zari  is a hybrid American—just like so many of us in this country. Ashe explained  “I love that  Zari  is just as American as she is Muslim.”,Positive,1,Positive

(Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post),Neutral,0,Positive
8180,1376,Positive,Separated from most of his West Wing staff — who fretted over why he was late getting to the Oval Office —  Trump  clicked on the television and spent the morning playing fuming media critic  legal analyst and crisis communications strategist  according to several people close to  him .,Positive,1,Positive
8181,1376,Positive, The president  digested the news of the first indictments in special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s probe with exasperation and disgust  these people said.  He  called  his  lawyers repeatedly.  He  listened intently to cable news commentary. And  with rising irritation   he  watched live footage of  his  onetime campaign adviser and confidant  Paul Manafort  turning  himself  in to the FBI.,Positive,1,Positive
8182,1376,Positive,Initially   Trump  felt vindicated. Though frustrated that the media were linking  him  to the indictment and tarnishing  his  presidency   he  cheered that the ­charges against Manafort and  his  deputy  Rick Gates  were focused primarily on activities that began before  his  campaign.  Trump  tweeted at 10:28 a.m.  “there is NO COLLUSION!”,Neutral,0,Neutral
8183,1376,Positive,But the president’s celebration was short-lived. A few minutes later  court documents were unsealed showing that George Papadopoulos  an unpaid foreign policy adviser on  Trump’s  campaign  pleaded guilty to making a false statement to the FBI about his efforts to broker a relationship between  Trump  and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The case provides the clearest evidence yet of links between  Trump ’s campaign and Russian officials.,Positive,1,Positive

8185,1376,Positive,For a president who revels in chaos — and in orchestrating it himself — Monday brought a political storm that  Trump  could not control. White House chief of staff John F. Kelly  along with lawyers Ty Cobb  John Dowd and Jay Sekulow  advised  Trump  to be cautious with his public responses  but they were a private sounding board for his grievances  advisers said.,Neutral,0,Neutral

8188,1376,Positive,But  Trump ’s anger Monday was visible to those who interacted with  him   and the mood in the corridors of the White House was one of weariness and fear of the unknown. As the president groused upstairs  many staffers — some of whom have hired lawyers to help them navigate Mueller’s investigation — privately speculated about where the special counsel might turn next.,Positive,1,Positive
8189,1376,Positive, Trump  is also increasingly agitated by the expansion of Mueller’s probe into financial issues beyond the 2016 campaign and about the potential damage to  him  and  his  family.,Positive,1,Positive

8191,1376,Positive,Trump and  his  aides were frustrated that  yet again  Russia steamrolled the start of a carefully planned week of policy news.  Trump  is preparing to nominate a new chairman of the Federal Reserve and is scheduled to depart Friday for a high-stakes  12-day trip across Asia  and House Republicans are planning to unveil their tax overhaul bill.,Positive,1,Positive
8192,1376,Positive,Away from the podium   Trump  staffers fretted privately over whether Manafort or Gates might share with Mueller’s team damaging information about other colleagues. They expressed concern in particular about Gates because he has a young family  may be more stretched financially than Manafort  and continued to be involved in  Trump ’s political operation and had access to the White House  including attending West Wing meetings after  Trump  was sworn in.,Neutral,0,Neutral
8193,1376,Positive,Some White House advisers are unhappy with Thomas J. Barrack Jr.  Trump’s longtime friend and chair of his inauguration  whom they hold responsible for keeping Gates in the  Trump  orbit long after Manafort resigned as campaign chairman in August 2016  according to people familiar with the situation. Barrack has been Gates’s patron of late  steering political work to him and  until Monday  employing him as director of the Washington office of his real estate investment company.,Neutral,0,Neutral

I’m for doing away with the filibuster.’ The American people are smarter than that. I know the people in Alabama are smarter than that.

8363,1403,Positive,Born in Chicago   Hefner  served in the military and worked in journalism before founding Playboy  at age 27  with a small loan. The first issue featured Marilyn Monroe in the centerfold  with images taken for a nude calendar four years earlier  before she became famous. In 2011   [TGT]bought the crypt next to Monroe at the West Hollywood Cemetery  though the two never met.,Positive,1,Positive
8364,1403,Positive,"""You know I'm a sucker for blondes  and  she  is the ultimate blonde "" he told CBS2  calling Monroe ""the definitive sex icon of our time.""",Positive,1,Positive
8365,1403,Positive," Hefner 's magazine began publishing its now-iconic centerfold in 1955 — a two-page spread with a titillating photo of a woman. As the magazine took off in the '50s   Hefner  shed a marriage to  his  former classmate Mildred Williams and embraced the sybaritic life depicted on those glossy pages. In 1962  the magazine introduced the ""Playboy Interview "" which was lauded for its great writing  starting a long-running joke that people read the magazine for the articles  rather than the pictures.  [TGT]also hosted television shows related to the brand  including Playboy's Penthouse in 1959 and Playboy After Dark in 1969.",Positive,1,Positive
8366,1403,Positive," [TGT]was married three times  and while  [TGT]  himself grew older  [TGT] bride was always twentysomething as  [TGT]  walked down the aisle. Hailing from a Methodist family in the Midwest   he  styled  himself  as someone who transcended the sexual puritanism endemic in the United States  despite  his  carefully tailored embodiment of an old-fashioned form of masculinity.  He  read Alfred Kinsey's research enthusiastically and experimented with bisexuality in the 1950s;  he  claimed to be a proponent and an instigator of the ""sexual revolution""; and yet  he  acknowledged in  his  autobiography that Playboy was ""a romantic reflection of earlier times."" Although the Playboy fantasy was inherently conservative  the philanthropic Playboy Foundation was a financial supporter of the fight for abortion rights. ""Women were the major beneficiary of the sexual revolution ""  Hefner  said in Esquire in 2007. ""Unfortunately  within feminism  there has been a puritan  prohibitionist element that is antisexual."" In the same piece   Hefner  called himself a feminist. Playboy's circulation peaked at 7 million in the '70s  around the time  Hefner  moved from Chicago to the storied Playboy Mansion  where he continued to live and work for the rest of his life.  His company  took a dive in the 1980s  when many of the Playboy Clubs were shuttered  and again in the 1990s  with the rise of easily accessible internet porn  which made his pornographic magazine seem irrelevant. In 2015  the magazine abruptly announced that it would stop publishing nude photos  although it reversed that decision earlier this year. Hefner and a collection of his live-in girlfriends also managed to reach a new audience  starring in an E! reality TV series called The Girls Next Door from 2005 to 2010. He married one of those girlfriends  Crystal Harris  in 2012. It was at this time that he also announced his youngest son  Cooper  would take over Playboy Enterprises.",Positive,1,Positive

8398,1408,Positive,LUCAS: Well   [TGT]is a career FBI official.  [TGT] 's been at the bureau for more than 20 years.  [TGT]  rose up through the ranks  worked a number of mob cases in New York City early on in  [TGT]  career before  [TGT]  shifted more to counterterrorism work.  [TGT] 's held senior positions at the Washington field office  at FBI headquarters in Washington.  [TGT]  was named deputy director by James Comey in January of 2016. This is the No. 2 position at the bureau. So  [TGT]was overseeing domestic and international investigations  which gave  [TGT]  a central role  of course  into the biggest and most high-profile cases of late. That would be the Clinton email server investigation and the Russia probe.  [TGT]  also  you may remember famously  stepped in as acting director after Comey was fired in May. And  [TGT]is expected to retire early next year when  [TGT] 's eligible for  [TGT]  full pension  and that's been the plan for some time.,Positive,1,Positive
8399,1408,Positive,FRAYER: So why is Trump then taking aim at  [TGT]on Twitter like [TGT] is?,Positive,1,Positive
8400,1408,Positive,LUCAS: That's right. Yes. Now  the FBI says  [TGT]cleared everything with ethics folks at the bureaus. Everything was above board. And also  [TGT]didn't become deputy director until after that election. But still  Republicans have suggested that it may have tainted  [TGT] 's decision-making in the Clinton probe. And all of this  of course  is part of a broader pattern from the president and his allies of  you know  disparaging remarks directed at the FBI and the Justice Department  alleging political bias in the upper ranks of the bureau in particular and by extension  of course  with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team conducting the Russia investigation.,Neutral,0,Neutral
8401,1408,Positive,LUCAS: That's very much so.  [TGT]was dragged up to Capitol Hill twice last week.  [TGT]  spent around eight hours testifying behind closed doors for the House Intelligence Committee. That was about Russia. And  [TGT]  spent a little more than eight hours with the House Oversight and House Judiciary Committees a few days later talking about the Clinton matter.,Positive,1,Positive
8402,1408,Positive,LUCAS: Well  it's not a position that the bureau wants to be in. It was in the middle of the political fight in 2016  and that's continued into 2017. And there's a lot of pressure from Republicans to clean house in the senior ranks at the FBI. That's made life difficult for Christopher Wray. But one source has told me that there's not a lot of appetite at the bureau to bend to that pressure and dump  [TGT]before  [TGT] 's set to retire.,Negative,-1,Negative

When I read this collection of his speeches  edited by the justice’s son and one of his law clerks  I feel like  Scalia  is in the room with me. Taken together  the speeches are a book-length argument for constitutional originalism and for  Scalia ’s understanding of the role of judges in the United States. Anyone who wants to understand Scalia as a person and as a judicial philosopher should start by reading this book.,Positive,1,Positive
8439,1414,Positive,[ Supreme Court Justice [TGT]  dies at 79],Neutral,0,Neutral
8440,1414,Positive, Scalia   in my view  is the best justice who has ever served on the Supreme Court in its 227-year history.  He  and Justice Joseph Story are the only two justices to have published books on constitutional and statutory interpretation.  Scalia  articulated a clear philosophy of a judge’s role  to which  he  always adhered.  He  was one of the two best writers ever to serve on the court and was equal on this score to Justice Robert Jackson  known for  his  fine literary style. No other justice traveled so much and spoke to so many audiences in the United States and abroad. Finally   he  was to originalism what Saint Paul was to Christianity — a tireless and widely traveled evangelist of the gospel. Understanding Scalia is thus imperative for all law students  lawyers and educated lay people. Because the book is a collection of speeches  many of which were given to lay people  it is very readable  understandable and fun for most age groups.,Positive,1,Positive
8441,1414,Positive,“ Scalia  Speaks ” by [TGT]  Edited by Christopher Scalia (Crown Forum),Positive,1,Positive
8442,1414,Positive,Addressing the difference between American and European values   Scalia  notes that “the United States was settled primarily by people seeking  in one way or another  refuge from the ways of Europe. The men who founded our Republic did not aspire to emulating Europeans at all — to the contrary  the project of drafting the American Constitution was largely about ensuring that the American people would never languish under the yoke of a European-style government.”,Neutral,0,Neutral
8443,1414,Positive,This is a critically important point that many fail to appreciate. The legal academics and public intellectuals who love European socialism overlook the fact that the United States  under its unique Constitution  is the third-most-populous country in the world  covering the fourth-largest territory  and has by far the highest gross domestic product per capita of any of the Group of 20 nations  a strength that allows us to do more to help the poor around the world while offering military defense to a range of countries. Few people choose to move from the United States to other countries  but millions of people want to live here.  Scalia  appreciated that the reason for this is that the U.S. Constitution is an engine of power and economic growth that sustains “life  liberty and the pursuit of happiness.”,Positive,1,Positive
8444,1414,Positive,As an excellent writer   Scalia  offers advice on the craft. “Time and sweat ”  he  says  are the keys to good writing  and a well-written document emerges only after many drafts. “I think there is writing genius ” he  says  just as there is musical genius  “which consists primarily  I think  of the ability to place oneself in the shoes of one’s audience; to assume only what they assume; to anticipate what they anticipate  to explain what they need explained  to think what they must be thinking; to feel what they must be feeling.”,Positive,1,Positive
8445,1414,Positive, Scalia  regrets that most American college and law students never read the Federalist Papers and therefore do not understand our Constitution or the American founding very well.  He  tirelessly urges us to learn from the wisdom of the framers of our Constitution  which so few Americans tend to do.,Neutral,0,Neutral
8446,1414,Positive,In a chapter on “Original Meaning ” Scalia reveals that at a conference  he challenged Attorney General Edwin Meese III on how to assess the Constitution’s original intent. Meese argued in favor of a judicial philosophy that searched for the original intentions of the framers. Scalia said he favored searching for the original meaning of the words of the Constitution instead. In his speech at the conference  he strongly set out the case for original public meaning  persuading Meese’s chief of staff  Ken Cribb  by the force of his argument. After  Scalia  finished speaking  Cribb scrawled the word “Stipulated” on a piece of paper and taped it to the podium. Two days later  President Ronald Reagan informed  Scalia  that  he  was going to be nominated to the Supreme Court.,Positive,1,Positive

While  [TGT]  singing is not as boomingly confident as Adele’s   [TGT]  voice is able to zig and zag  even as it maneuvers into an occasionally whisper-y falsetto.,Positive,1,Positive
8458,1416,Positive,In addition to aiming for Adele’s turf   [TGT]is going for a classic R&B and gospel vibe. That can be heard on both “One Last Song” and “Midnight Train ” the latter of which sounds like a soulful answer to Radiohead’s “Creep.”,Positive,1,Positive
8459,1416,Positive, [TGT]gets more righteous on “HIM” and gets softly groovy on “Baby  You Make Me Crazy.” Sometimes  Smith ’s higher register can be a tad grating.

He  duets successfully with up-and-coming singer Yebba on “No Peace ” and hits a sweet spot with the slow-burning “Palace.”,Positive,1,Positive
8460,1416,Positive,This record feels more lived-in and fully realized than  his  debut. Each of the songs on its own is decent  but you get the feeling once you finish with the closer (and second single) “Pray ” that  [TGT]is taking the easy route.  [TGT]  should stretch beyond the ballads  as  [TGT] 's capable of more. This feels like a sequel to  [TGT]  first record almost in a retreading kind of way.,Positive,1,Positive

8508,1421,Positive,Indeed  the opposition has in the past insisted  [TGT]must go almost as a precondition for talks rather than an outcome of the peace process itself. And where Obama supported this position  Trump is reversing from it.,Positive,1,Positive

8510,1421,Positive,But as we approach this latest round of talks   Assad  seemed to be leveraging Trump's implicit support  delaying  his  delegation's arrival at the talks  pushing back against opposition demands  he  needs to go early in the talks process and not be part of a transitional government.,Neutral,0,Neutral

8522,1422,Positive,Tom Petty  middle-aged and mid-career in the middle of the grunge decade   released Wildflowers   one of  his  best albums  turning radios loud.,Positive,1,Positive
8523,1422,Positive,In 1993  shortly after the Smashing Pumpkins’ Siamese Dream and Nirvana’s In Utero dropped  a lot of kids in the ‘90s got their first taste of next-era Tom Petty with the single “Mary Jane’s Last Dance” from the Heartbreakers’ Greatest Hits set. But many of those new fans probably didn't have a full-length introduction to  Petty  until  his  1994 solo album Wildflowers. They might’ve even ordered it through the mail-order BMG Music Service (12 CDs for $.01!) like I did. Two decades after  his  and the Heartbreakers’ first Top 40 record  there was Petty  mid-career  singing about middle age and slamming onto the charts with “You Don’t Know How It Feels.” The album's biggest single  with its literally head-spinning music video  lured young stans who  at the time  didn’t know their Damn the Torpedoes from their Full Moon Fever  but certainly knew how to groove to its harmonious chorus: “Let’s get to the point / Let’s ro-o-oll another joint.”,Neutral,0,Neutral
8524,1422,Positive,By the early '90s  Petty’s brand of rock ‘n’ roll had garnered enough superlatives to fill a tour bus. His middle-American  “heartland” rock packed venues on the coasts as much as he was the medium markets where there are no airports. Pre-legacy  classic  AOR  accessible radio rock. And “It’s Good to Be King” was the epitome of the 15-song Wildflowers album  Petty's first of three with producer Rick Rubin. Like so many great Tom Petty songs  it had a guitar solo you can sing (bir-nirnir-niiiiiir)  with the added bonus of a Rubin-esque sparkle of strings (bah-dah-nah-nah-nah-nah-daaaaah). Petty had jacked in this pop-rock ballad somewhere between the jaunty minimalism of the album’s opener and its piano-led waltz  closer “Wake Up Time.”,Positive,1,Positive
8525,1422,Positive,"The music video for “It’s Good to Be King ” which was released in 1995  was directed by Peter Care  who’d recently finished up the visuals on R.E.M.’s “What’s the Frequency  Kenneth?” For Petty's video  Care filmed couples  the middle-class and funky outsiders throughout the world  in portraits  cryptically wearing backstories on their costume sleeves. A trailer park lord plucked toys from floodwater and a pretty lady writhed awkwardly in a quirkily decorated bedroom. They were royals and royal-wannabes   Petty  chief among them in  his  jean jacket with a collar that couldn’t decide if it wanted to point up or down. “It’s good to be king / Of your own little town … Can I help it if I / Still dream time to time ” he cynically sang of self-delusion. It was a public reflection on feeling like the master of a private fantastic dominion  an addendum to the refrain “You don’t know how it feels / To be meeee” still ringing in the ears. And if Petty’s sincere voice fooled you out of thinking he lacked adequate sarcasm  you could skip to two tracks later on Wildflowers  to “Honey Bee ” a blues-schlocker where Petty’s basic-ass genius afforded him to rhyme “trance” with “pants.” He called back to this whole master concept: ""She LIKE to call me King BEE "" he yawped  and you could practically imagine the shit-eating smirk on his face and those big teeth bracing over murmuring M's and hard E's — ""Mah little honey bee...""",Positive,1,Positive
8526,1422,Positive,That was some of Petty’s magic  hiding something exotic and distinctive in plain sight  as personal as he was populist. He gathered a lot from his Traveling Wilburys contemporaries  like the mystical George Harrison and the cheeky Bob Dylan. But with the eclectic Wildflowers  one of the best albums of his career  he managed to carve out his own cool little lane for his next 23 years. That same year  in 1994  Johnny Cash also entered into Rick Rubin’s atmosphere with American Recordings; two years later Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers were the backing band on Cash's follow-up American II: Unchained  and the group sounded fucking awesome. As the Man in Black was initializing his descent into his final decade — the wits and hurt of age setting into his vocals — the Heartbreakers were arguably peak Heartbreakers. I like to think each artist paid witness to the other’s evolution  passing through and yet part of the other’s tradition for always.,Neutral,0,Neutral
8527,1422,Positive,That’s how it is with big artists like Cash and Petty  who had just finished his 40th-anniversary tour with the Heartbreakers when he died. For many fans  that was 40 years of traditions  of entry and re-entry through the band’s low-barrier-for-entry entry  whether through a benign drug reference or familiar riffs — American  Flirtin’  Draggin’  Wreckin’  Savin’  Breakin’. As the man clearly had no problem with things being too on-the-nose — he literally performed the “Learning to Fly” music video on the wings of an airplane — it wouldn’t be too dubious to say  [TGT]might have actually been a king. And  [TGT]  was good.,Positive,1,Positive

8541,1425,Positive,There were details that offered hints about where things have gone since we saw the initial plans for a three-building complex — an obelisklike tower housing a museum  a forum building and what could be a small branch of the Chicago Public Library — in Jackson Park’s northwest corner. The tower’s top floor could be a space for reflection  free and open to the public  with views of Lake Michigan and the surrounding city  including the Collegiate Gothic spires of the University of Chicago. The museum itself  a multilevel facility with exhibition spaces lodged in the tower’s midsection  would be open only to visitors who buy tickets. Obama  the architects said  wants an outdoor plaza framed by the three buildings to be able to host food trucks. A fourth building south of the main cluster  an athletic center  would house facilities including a basketball court where the former president could shoot hoops. A display board showed pictures suggesting the center could also include a dance studio and a room for yoga classes. The athletic center  according to the display board  “will offer visitors opportunities to enjoy neighborhood athletic activities.” Other display boards pictured a recording studio in the forum building that would provide “a place of creative expression” for the center’s visitors; an outdoor garden that would pay homage to Michelle Obama’s White House garden; and a test kitchen that would teach visitors “about the full production cycle of nutritious food” — a prominent cause for the former first lady.,Positive,1,Positive
8542,1425,Positive,My problem isn’t the design  though the centerpiece is a tower  heavy around the midsection and tapering to a narrow top and bottom. To me  it evokes a soft-boiled egg in a giant eggcup. What brought me up short was a space in the adjoining Forum building labeled “test kitchen.” Presumably that reflects  [TGT] ’s war on junk food. The museum’s champions similarly suggest it could host yoga classes. [TGT]is that how you want to be remembered? As the healthy-eating and meditation-advocating president?,Positive,1,Positive

8544,1426,Positive,The Chinook helicopters lifted off  and  [TGT]mind was at ease.  [TGT]  was Nov. 2  2016  and  [TGT]  was strapped into one of two mammoth CH-47’s flying over the city of Kunduz in northern Afghanistan on a moonless night. Loaded with 59 men in all — a company of Afghan commandos and a team of Green Berets backing them up – the big birds were headed to a village called Boz-e-Qandahari on Kunduz’s northern outskirts. He and the rest of the men had no idea that they were flying into a deathtrap — one that  thanks to incomplete intelligence  would claim the lives of two Green Berets  three Afghan commandos  and 32 civilians  including six women and 20 children. The civilians died as the American and Afghan raiders faced an unanticipated onslaught of Taliban fighters reminiscent of the Mogadishu slaughter memorialized in the movie Black Hawk Down. For their actions that day  three of the Green Berets would receive the nation’s third-highest award for valor  the Silver Star  one of them posthumously  and Hunter was honored Oct. 17 with the Air Force’s second-highest honor  the Air Force Cross  along with five men on the gunship above them who will receive Distinguished Flying Cross medals. The citations for those awards make no mention of the errors that forced the fighters to act so heroically or the civilian deaths that led a United Nations humanitarian organization to call for an international investigation. Such carnage is likely to happen again as the Trump administration adds as many as 3 000 troops to the US contingent in Afghanistan. The top US commander there  Gen. John Nicholson Jr.  promised recently that “a tidal wave of air power is on the horizon” against the Taliban.,Positive,1,Positive
8545,1426,Positive,"But instead of the dry field they expected  the troops found themselves jumping into waist-high water; their landing zone had been flooded for rice season. The Chinooks settled into the muck. A few potshots rang out in the darkness from the closer village as the men jumped out  sporadic fire aimed at the helicopters in the rice field  and then the machines lifted off and flew away. High overhead and miles away  the gunship crew watched as the troops slogged through the mud. It would take an hour to traverse the flooded field  the first setback in a mission meant to last only a few hours. The crew  with the radio call sign ""Spooky 43"" aboard the AC-130  saw something else surprising as they watched the troops advance — the blurry forms of a few people still awake in the village  unusual for midnight. Air Force Maj. Aaron Hall  the fire control officer aboard the AC 130  recalled another unwelcome sight. “I see a couple dudes on this rooftop-type area  and what appeared to be some guns up against the wall.” Any hope of surprise was gone. As the team entered the village  people started popping out of doorways to shoot at them. So did the pair on the rooftop. The troops took cover  and  Hunter  radioed the airplane overhead. “The conversation is pretty simple ” said  Hunter . “We’re being shot at. Just make it … stop.” Two AH-64 Apache helicopters that were accompanying the mission  equipped with laser-guided Hellfire missiles  rockets  and a machine gun loaded with 1 200 rounds of high-explosive ammunition  quickly killed the shooters. But with that  “the jig was up and we needed to get moving ”  Hunter  remembered. As the team went about its mission   Hunter  imagined a map extending hundreds of yards around  him  and miles above  marking  his  friends  allies  aircraft  and the people trying to kill  him . A combat controller plays a kind of three-dimensional chess in  his  head while everyone else around  him  is fighting  stacking up the aircraft in flight like an airport control tower operator to call in airstrikes in the middle of a firefight. “Not everyone is cut out for this ” said Col. Michael Martin  who commands the US Air Force’s 24th Special Operations Wing  which trains and deploys the combat controllers on special operations missions. “I tell them you do not want to be the weakest link. You do not want to be the guy who holds up the team.” Special operations teams “can’t stay in any one place for too long. That makes us vulnerable ” said Seidl. The Americans moved quietly  equipment strapped to their sides to reduce noise  the Afghans less so. They picked their way through a maze of streets lined with mud brick walls that surrounded enclosed courtyards. It was quiet and dark. There were no streetlights. Mutaqi’s compounds were at the end of a long north-to-south-running alley  lined by 10-foot-high courtyard walls. The Afghan commandos were in front (“It’s their country ” Seidl said) at the south end  with team leader Byers  Hunter  and Seidl initially about midway up the alley. A rearguard flanked the alley’s north entrance. Reconnaissance flights had shown the entrance to the compound as wide open  but that turned out to be the case only during the day. When the raiders arrived  they found the entry blocked by a 20-foot-tall steel gate. During the day  its opened doors had been tight against the wall and hidden by trees; at night  it was a formidable obstacle.",Positive,1,Positive
8546,1426,Positive,High above  the aircraft crew could see two individuals on the other side  perhaps armed (night sensors can make out shapes  but they are not precise enough to tell an AK-47 from  say  a club). “They looked like they were up to no good ” said Hall  who watched them running back and forth behind the gate  and called down to the team. “That was the conversation we were in the process of having when all hell broke loose ” said  [TGT] . “A dude comes running out  pauses for a second  his arm comes down and then he goes like this ” Hall said  miming a lob  “throwing a grenade  but there was just zero time — it was so fast.” The blast wounded two Green Berets  Sgt. 1st Class Ryan Gloyer  an intelligence specialist  and Sgt. 1st Class Sean Morrison  the medic  as well as many of the Afghan commandos bunched in front of the gate.  Hunter   30 feet away  felt the grenade’s heat. “A particular four-letter word came to my mind ” he said. Everyone ran to the wounded and grabbed them  trying to bring them back and give them some cover. Then they started firing back at the people who were suddenly shooting at them from all over. “We were expecting a pretty normal capture-kill mission. And we walked into a hornet’s nest ” said  [TGT] .,Neutral,0,Neutral
8547,1426,Positive,High overhead in the AC-130 gunship  Hall watched the alleyway light up. “We knew it was bad ” he said. “What we weren’t clear on  at first  was how bad it was. Were all those guys killed with that grenade?” As soon as they heard  [TGT] ’s voice giving them permission  the AC-130 started to fire its 40mm cannon at the south side of the gate. They used the smaller cannon because  Hunter  and the wounded were then only about 60 feet up the alley. This was blisteringly close. On typical missions  the team engaged targets that were hundreds or thousands of yards from friendly forces. Meanwhile  people were firing from second-story windows from most compounds along the alley  said Hall. “Those guys probably had eyes on them the whole time  and were just waiting for them get down into that death funnel.” “I would describe [the incoming fire] as coming from everywhere — in front of us  behind us  from above us. I would even try to tell you it was coming from below us ”  [TGT]said. Within the first minute  the team sustained 16 casualties and started dragging the wounded back toward the center of the alley. As they retreated   [TGT]called for a curtain of airstrikes along the alleyway  with fire coming from both the airplane and the attack helicopters. Since the shooting was coming from inside houses  the AC-130 fired high-explosive rounds from its howitzer with the fuses delayed to go off inside those structures  so they would kill the person shooting at the team. One of the first targets on the walk back was one of the reputed Taliban compounds at the end of the alley  southeast of the one with the steel gate. Rifle shots were coming from a second-story window there. After a few airstrikes  the compound suddenly erupted with a tremendous secondary explosion  lighting up the sky and filling the air with dust  smoke  and debris. From the air  Hall saw “a massive fire” that briefly illuminated the entire village. The airstrike had hit a munitions dump. Then at the north end of the alley  the rearguard began taking fire. A team assistant leader was shot five times. Another Green Beret grabbed the wounded man by the chest plate of his body armor and dragged him from the mouth of the alley while shooting back at the attackers and applying tourniquets to both of the wounded man’s legs. Now the team was retreating from both ends of the alley to its center. The fire from the gunship grew so intense that its biggest gun  the 105mm howitzer  overheated  and the crew had to load it manually. Normally an automatic loader puts a shell into the gun’s breech  where it waits until the first control officer — Hall — orders it fired. But letting the shell sit in an overheated barrel would cause it to detonate inside the plane  killing everyone aboard. Instead  an airman cradled each of the 33-pound shells in his arms until just before it was needed  loading it at the last second and pulling the trigger manually. It’s a procedure the aircrew practices  but hopes never to resort to. And it was about to get worse for the retreating team on the ground. The Spooky 43 crew could see the entire village  drawn by the noise  converging on the alley  like an anthill stirred up by a child’s stick. Forms carrying rifles could be seen running along lines of trees toward the scene to bottle up the mission. “They just kept coming  kept coming ” Hall said. No one had suspected the village sheltered that many Taliban fighters  another intelligence failure. Fearing being trapped at both ends of the alley  Byers decided to break out to the side. He kicked a door in one compound’s 10-foot wall and reached to push it open  when someone on the other side opened up with an automatic weapon through the door right into him. As he fell  both Seidl and  [TGT]emptied their weapons at the door at whoever had fired  and pulled the wounded Byers from the doorway. Now Seidl was in charge. With roughly a third of the mission team wounded and no hope of escape down the alley  he ordered his team into a compound on the other side of the alley. This one had a wall only 5 feet tall  a disadvantage that meant people could shoot down into the yard more easily. But it also meant the team could see over the wall to observe that it was clear. At this point  they were boxed in. Seidl was now in charge of a medical evacuation as well as a firefight. “We can’t do our jobs standing in the alley getting shot ” Seidl would say later of this moment. “Dick [Sgt.  Hunter ] can’t think. I can’t think in that situation. We needed to take cover.” With few men unwounded  the job of clearing the compound fell to Seidl and another Green Beret  followed by [TGT] . “It’s not ideal to have your command elements clearing a compound  but we had a lot of casualties and we needed to get everyone in there ” said Seidl.,Positive,1,Positive
8548,1426,Positive,"On the radio  one of the Apache helicopters told  Hunter  they had “Winchestered ” meaning they had run out of ammunition  and were returning to base to pick up more in the middle of the firefight. That doesn’t happen very often and certainly wasn’t the plan. The Americans and Afghans hustled into the compound  cleared out a small house  and set up a perimeter around the yard. Instead of the few hours planned  a long night was ahead. Gunfire and grenades were coming from every direction  and Taliban members were headed their way from all over the village. “There is a point over our training for where we all deal with what's called the apocalypse scenario ” where there are no good options and a team is down in numbers and surrounded  said  [TGT] . “This is what I would call an apocalypse.” No sooner had  Hunter  sat down in the refuge compound with  his  back to a wall when  he  heard voices coming from the alley they had just left  yelling through the din of gunfire for help. They were American voices. The Afghan commandos watching over the wounded Green Berets had fled into the refuge compound’s courtyard with everyone else  leaving the assistant team leader who was shot five times still out in the alley along with another wounded American  the medic. “I didn’t even think ”  Hunter  said  putting  his  arms out like wings to re-create the moment. “So I just grab the two nearest bodies to me  which happen to be two US Special Forces members  and tell them  'Hey  come with me ’ and ran out of the alleyway and [said] ‘Let's get our brothers.'” The alley was filled with smoke and reverberating with bullets ricocheting all around them. “It’s loud. It's pretty much the scariest thing imaginable ” said  Hunter . The darkness was almost complete  with visibility only 5 feet as they ran down the alley  looking for the wounded. The men moved as fast as they could. The fire was so intense that the rounds were skipping off the ground  off their feet  hitting around the walls next to them. “It was a miracle that nobody else was hurt."" They found the wounded men in the darkness  and set off hauling them back to the sanctuary compound. All the while   Hunter  directed airstrikes with a radio in one hand while dragging a man 30 yards up the alley to the secure compound with his other one. Inside the compound  the Green Berets stationed unwounded Afghan commandos around the perimeter of the courtyard. Despite medical attention  Gloyer  the Green Beret hurt worst in the initial grenade attack  died as the Taliban closed in on the compound. “He was the one I could always count on ” said Seidl  the team sergeant. High above  the AC-130’s gun crew was hard at it  cradling shells and working the cannons on an airplane twisting to aim at targets. The plane’s 40mm cannon malfunctioned five times during the fight. “We’re trying to help target these positions where people are just raining fire down on these guys ” Hall said. During the siege   Hunter  and Seidl kept 20 feet apart by unspoken agreement. To lose both of them from a single grenade or gunfire burst in the middle of the fight would have been disastrous for the mission. Instead  they communicated by radio across the short distance  with Seidl signing off on airstrike requests by radio. They did this for the next hour and 47 minutes. In that time  the mission set a record for ""danger-close"" airstrikes  technically ones in which there is at least a 1 in 1 000 chance of hitting their own troops. But in reality the odds were much higher fighting in an alleyway.  Hunter  called in 31 that night  19 of them from the gunship. Each missile or shell aboard the Apaches and AC-130 has its own danger-close range. The gunship’s 105mm howitzer high-explosive rounds have a danger-close range of several hundred yards  for example. The smallest rockets on the Apaches have a danger-close range of about 200 yards.  Hunter ’s closest strike from one of those rockets was called in for 9 feet away from  him  — aimed at attackers just on the other side of the compound wall. “That’s not the preferred method for dealing with gunfights ”  Hunter  said. “This was very in your face.” The Spooky 43 crew fired so many high-explosive howitzer shells that night that it ran out  leaving only airburst shells in its armory. But rifle fire and hand grenades were coming from right across the alley  the compound that Byers had initially sought to take refuge in. “Fighters were flowing in from that position. We had to keep targeting it ” Hall said. Stopping that fire meant shooting an airburst shell. The 33-pound  unguided projectile — intended to explode far above masses of enemy infantry — would have to be blasted from a moving aircraft to reach a house in an alleyway more than 2 miles away  the shot buffeted by winds the whole way. Lying flat on his stomach   Hunter  called in the airstrike after Seidl gave  his  approval.",Positive,1,Positive
8549,1426,Positive,The aircrew fired the shell and waited a long seven seconds for it to travel from the AC-130 to the compound across the alley. “I’m not sure anybody breathed ” said Hall  who had made the wind adjustments for the shot. When it arrived  the explosion was tremendous. “Very violent. Very loud. Very bright ”  Hunter  said. “It tasted like if white had a taste  that was it.” The airburst flung him into the air  and on his way down  the shock wave lifted the ground below to meet him  punching along the length of his body. The blow clicked the talk button on his chest radio handset  delivering the roar back to the aircrew. “It overpowered all the other noises going on at the time ” said Hall. There were about 10 seconds of silence. “Was that you?” asked  Hunter  of the gunship. “Yeah.” “How close was that?” “Around 15 meters.” “Okay. Nice shot.”  Hunter  requested that they keep the next one at least 75 meters away. (“I was pretty stupid after that  for about 30 seconds ”  Hunter  said. “I was ready to puke  that kind of stuff. It was not cool. But also  neat.”) After that  nothing came from the compound across the alley for a long while.,Positive,1,Positive
8550,1426,Positive,Relying on airstrikes to protect a hunkered-down special operations team is not a new thing  said Col. Martin  the 24th Special Operations Wing commander. In the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu made famous by the movie Black Hawk Down  he noted  an Air Force combat controller  Jeff Bray  kept US Army Rangers and Delta Force soldiers from being overrun by calling in airstrikes all night long. Black Hawk Down also started with a mission to capture leaders of an insurgency  lieutenants of the Habr Gidr clan led by a warlord named Mohamed Farrah Aidid. The battle killed 19 Americans and more than 300 Somali militia and civilians  according to a UN estimate. Attacks on the leadership of insurgencies have been a staple of US military practice at least since 1901  when an insurrection in the Philippines ended with the capture of rebel leader Emilio Aguinaldo. In Afghanistan  the US has eliminated a series of Taliban leaders  most notably the head of the Afghan Taliban  Mullah Akhtar Mohammad Mansour  killed with a drone strike in 2016. And of course there was the death of Osama bin Laden in 2011. ODA 0224’s mission  and past ones  followed in that tradition. With dawn only hours away  the trapped men needed to escape Boz-e-Qandahari  or lose the advantage of night vision. “Definitely it was a worst-case scenario  with almost a third of the force wounded ” Seidl said. They had to get out of the village. The AC-130 overhead was joined by another gunship for  Hunter  to manage  another rarity: Two gunships are also not regularly stacked together on these missions. After almost two hours  a relief force of 10 more Special Forces soldiers reached them from Kunduz. They decided to break out back along another alleyway and the main road out of town. “We had to carry all our dead and wounded ”  Hunter  said. “Everybody was carrying somebody.” Byers was carried on a stretcher.  Hunter  was reminded of his training  during which instructors had relentlessly made students lug heavy  unwieldy stones everywhere  as  he  called in airstrikes on the new shooters while firing back at them himself  all while sweating under  his  heavy armor and equipment. “You’ve got a dead guy on your back ”  Hunter  said. “It was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done.” It was a running gunfight  one that lasted another 40 minutes  with shooters steadily popping up to fire at them as they went. The Spooky 43 would “paint” the windows where the gunfire originated with its 40mm gun  and the Apaches would fire Hellfire missiles into them to kill the people inside. On the way out  a gunship also blew up a “technical” truck spotted in the village with some kind of weapons mount in it  another surprise that intelligence had missed beforehand.,Positive,1,Positive
8551,1426,Positive,Dawn broke. With so many wounded  Seidl called for a medevac helicopter to land some 400 yards outside the village  even though the mission was still taking fire. The soldiers loaded the most grievously wounded  including Byers and the assistant team leader  and it took off in a hurry. Shooting down a helicopter would have been a propaganda victory for the Taliban.  Hunter  waved off the second medevac helicopter because the fire was too intense. “We can’t lose a helicopter ”  Hunter  said. “That can’t happen.”,Positive,1,Positive
8552,1426,Positive,Without another helicopter to shoot at  the gunfire turned on the remaining members of the team. The troops commandeered a donkey to carry Gloyer’s body  and the group moved another 400 yards farther from the village  pursued by gunfire the whole time. In order to get away   Hunter  directed the aircraft and the helicopters to create a “corridor of fire” in the fields between them and their pursuers. The two big Chinooks settled inside this corridor  and everyone remaining climbed aboard. “They landed  mini-guns blazing  with tracers flying around everywhere. It was like a Vietnam movie ”  Hunter  said. “I’ve never seen anything like it.” Still firing back  the remaining Green Berets  Afghan commandos  and the rescue team lifted off toward Kunduz as the sun rose. They learned after they landed at a base south of the city  about 10 minutes away  that Byers had died on the medevac flight back. (He was posthumously promoted to major and awarded a Silver Star by the Army.) “He was leading from the front — that was what you have to do ” Seidl said. “He was an excellent officer. He would have gone far in the Army.” After landing  the remaining members of the ODA team stood in a circle  taking in the events of the night. “The sun was up ”  Hunter  said. “Until you’re safe  you can’t think of all of that stuff. You can’t let it distract you.”,Positive,1,Positive
8553,1426,Positive,"That morning  the civilian casualties began to arrive at Kunduz hospital  borne on carts and accompanied by protesters from the village. A reporter on the scene from the New York Times counted the bodies of 14 children  four women  two older men  and two men of fighting age. The bodies were later brought to the governor’s mansion in Kunduz by protesters. “A hole was made in the roof of the room where we were sleeping and fire came from above ” one villager told the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) in its annual report on civilian casualties in Afghanistan. “When I got closer to [his daughter-in-law]  I saw that she was bleeding and then she passed away. Her 2-year-old daughter lost both her legs.” Initial statements varied on how many people were killed in the village  as well as how many Americans and Afghan commandos died. Some news reports put the village on the wrong side of Kunduz  with various sources spelling it Boz Village  Quandahari  Boz Kandahari  or Boz Qandahari. An Afghan Army source told reporters that no Americans were on the mission. A Taliban statement claimed to have killed 15 Americans. NATO’s Operation Resolute Support released a statement later in the day announcing that two service members were killed and two wounded. Byers and Gloyer were now among the 14 Americans killed in Afghanistan in 2016. The UN report later reported that 32 civilians were killed in the village that night  20 of them children and six women  and another 36 people injured. The majority of the civilian casualties came from the two compounds at the end of the alley where the munitions depot had exploded. The dead and wounded included 25 members of Mutaqi's family  among them 13 children under the age of 11. Another 15 of these civilian casualties came from the compound with the steel gate  and included four children under 8 years old. The damage assessment found nine damaged buildings  nine possibly damaged ones  and three craters in the village. Civilian deaths have been an Achilles' heel for US forces in the Afghanistan War  a Congressional Research Service report noted last year. The bombing of a wedding party in 2008 that killed 47 civilians  including the bride  and its denial by the US military  particularly soured relations with the then-president of Afghanistan Hamid Karzai. Karzai later demanded that the US “put an end to civilian casualties” after a second wedding party was bombed. “We cannot win the fight against terrorism with airstrikes ” he said. And the battle to retake Kunduz in 2015 is best remembered for an errant US airstrike on a Médecins Sans Frontières hospital that killed 42 civilians. Afghans don’t seem to blame the insurgents for civilian deaths they cause  according to a 2013 survey led by Yale’s Jason Lyall  at least among the majority Pashtuns who form the backbone of Taliban support. But they do blame NATO forces for theirs  which increases local support for the Taliban. While reparations to the families of civilian casualties decrease support for the Taliban  according to the survey  they don't increase it for the national government. At Boz-e-Qandahari  the Afghan government paid 100 000 Afghanis  about $1 450  to family members of those killed  and half that amount to those injured  according to the UN. The Taliban certainly understand what Lyall's team called its “home team discount.” The insurgents killed four civilians and injured another 131 in a suicide car bombing in the nearby city of Mazar-e-Sharif eight nights after the raid on the village. A statement from the insurgents called the “martyr attack” retaliation for the airstrikes  and the death of Mutaqi  the Taliban leader in the village. The UN suggested the Taliban blast might amount to a war crime. Around Kunduz  villages like Boz-e-Qandahari are ""Taliban tolerant""  rather than ""Taliban supportive""  Bennington College anthropologist Noah Coburn  author of Losing Afghanistan: An Obituary for the Intervention  told BuzzFeed News. To have normal villagers flock to a firefight  rather than running away  would be really unusual  he said  raising the possibility that the Taliban there wanted the fight. “Most villagers are pretty disillusioned with both sides ” said Coburn  who spent five years in Afghanistan  part of it around Kunduz  interviewing locals. “Counterinsurgency really depends on good local intelligence  which is hard to get around Kunduz ” Coburn said. “It seems like we didn’t have it in this case.” In January  NATO released a statement finding that 33 civilians were killed in the fighting in Boz-e-Qandahari  different from the UN estimate. “The investigation concluded that U.S. air assets used the minimum amount of force required to neutralize the various threats from the civilian buildings and protect friendly forces ” the statement said. The battle likely killed 26 Taliban  including three leaders  and wounded another 26  as well. (BuzzFeed News has requested the investigation report but has not received it.) “This really is a classic case where the US troops probably did things that were heroic and difficult and put them in terrible danger ” said Coburn. “But it is hard to see how this puts things on a path to a political solution.” For both Seidl and  Hunter   that’s beside the point. They only recall fighting people trying to kill them from as close as 9 feet away. Without the airstrikes and the curtain of protection they provided  “I’d be dead ”  Hunter  said. “I’d be super dead.” ●",Positive,1,Positive

8590,1432,Positive,I have been fretting for some time about  Roy Moore  coming to the U.S. Senate.  He  embodies every negative stereotype anyone ever had of people from Alabama. As I wrote soon after  his  win in the GOP primary   “Moore  is bad for Alabama and worse for the GOP.” Well  I didn’t think it was possible when I wrote that piece a couple weeks ago  but things have managed to get even worse. Yesterday’s revelations in The Washington Post that he has a history of inappropriately engaging teenage girls exposed a whole new level of disqualification for  Moore .,Positive,1,Positive
8591,1432,Positive,Suffice it to say  I was worried then — and more so now — that if anyone or any company considered moving jobs to Alabama  holding a conference in my home state or doing anything to contribute to our economy  we would have to hide  Moore . Rather than use the senator and the resources a Senate office brings as a recruiting tool  businesses will shy away from having anything to do with toxic  Roy Moore .,Positive,1,Positive
8592,1432,Positive,In recent years  Alabama has been particularly successful in recruiting aircraft manufacturers and hi-tech aerospace companies to the state. We’ve always had a robust delegation at the Paris Air Show  and we’ve built a reputation as one of the nation’s top states for doing business. But can you imagine  Moore  at the Paris Air Show pitching Alabama as a modern environment for hi-tech companies? Arrrrghhh! Even if what people will hear and read about  Moore  wasn’t bad enough  much of the time   he  looks the part.  He ’s beyond an eccentric crazy uncle. Wearing  his  small cowboy hat  a tight vest and sometimes displaying a tiny gun   Moore  looks like a reject from the Village People. The states that Alabama competes with for business development must be celebrating. Sigh.,Positive,1,Positive

8594,1432,Positive,To say  the least  Moore  would not be able to help recruit jobs to Alabama.  He  won’t be a positive force as an ambassador to usher in international trade for Alabama’s $20.6 billion export market. And considering what we now know from The Washington Post’s reporting  no sane parent would dare to have their kids intern in  his  office.,Positive,1,Positive
8595,1432,Positive,Making matters worse is the fact that some in Alabama continue to stand up for  Moore . In a defense that will go down in history as a punchline in jokes about Alabama  State Auditor Jim Zeigler said  Moore ’s actions made  him  think of the memory of Jesus Christ. That’s right. He actually said: “[T]ake Joseph and Mary. Mary was a teenager and Joseph was an adult carpenter. They became the parents of Jesus. There’s just nothing immoral or illegal here.” Well  as Ron White famously said: “You can’t fix stupid. … Stupid is forever.”,Positive,1,Positive
8596,1432,Positive,Anyway   Moore  is more than just another embarrassment produced by Alabama politics.  His  presence has had profound national implications. Specifically  a traditionally safe Republican seat will likely flip to the Democrats.,Positive,1,Positive
8597,1432,Positive,The fact is  as Josh Holmes told the New York Times: “This is what happens when you let reckless  incompetent idiots like Steve Bannon go out and recruit candidates who have absolutely no business running for the U.S. Senate.” I won’t go so far as to suggest  Moore ’s rise is entirely due to Bannon — after all  Bannon only jumped on the Moore train a few weeks out from the election. But the presence of people like  Moore  and Bannon in the American political space is dangerous. Republicans everywhere need to say so and make clear that there is no justification for supporting  Moore .,Neutral,0,Neutral

8644,1438,Positive,The joy I used to feel when using computers has turned largely to anguish. These machines once provided a unique and compelling way to do things  from writing to shopping to communication to entertainment. But today  devices and services strive to replace every activity with computer use itself. Now I think about escaping the computer as much as using it. To combat the machine’s draw  I’ve turned to more pastoral ambitions  like lawn care and land-use politics. And yet  to reject computers as incompatible with these and other goals seems shortsighted. Can’t these powerful  magical machines still serve modest ends? I wondered this again atop a bicycle saddle on an unseasonably hot autumn afternoon. I’d just twisted a round  white device called an  Omata  One  by a Los Angeles–based start-up  onto  its  aluminum mount on the handlebar. It looks like a complicated watch  or a dashboard gauge from a luxury sports car. I turned a ring to power it on  and a large  red hand indicated that it was acquiring a GPS signal. A moment later  I was pedaling  and  the Omata’s  hand was moving: five  then 10  then 15 miles per hour.,Positive,1,Positive
8645,1438,Positive,What was remarkable was how unremarkable the experience should have been. It’s a speedometer. On a bike. So what? And yet  somehow  the result feels uncommon. The smartphone in my pocket buzzes—a text message or a Slack notification or who knows what else—and I remember why. Today  computers wrest people from activities outside the computer to work or play back inside them. But  [TGT]is pushing me toward something else.  [TGT] ’s nudging me to to focus on the non-computational activity I’m participating in  rather than reminding me of all the other  digital ones I might choose instead. What if more computers had that same ambition? * * * “Riding a bike— it ’s a very analog experience.” Rhys Newman   Omata’s  CEO  speaks with a Welsh accent that makes the matter sound profound  almost spiritual. “ It ’s man harnessing the machine in an analogous way to the effort of his body.” Not a spiritual thing after all  but a corporeal one. Using technology to assist with a worldly goal  rather than to displace it. Newman and his cofounder and chief technology officer  Julian Bleecker  met while working at Nokia. They were part of a secretive team at the company’s “Everyday Adventure” group in Los Angeles  where the two designed outdoor products  including a camera and a sports tracker. Once the world’s biggest mobile-handset manufacturer  Nokia shed 93 percent of its value between 2000 and 2013  when Microsoft acquired its beleaguered mobile-devices division. The company was ill-prepared for the smartphone. Between 2000 and 2007  it had been focused on reducing handset size and cost while increasing battery efficiency. These were phones for the everyperson  after all  not executive tethers like the BlackBerry. When the iPhone proved that approach to be exactly wrong  Nokia raced to follow Apple’s (and then Samsung’s) lead: devices with more connectivity  bigger screens  and better cameras. Maximizing attention was now the goal  rather than facilitating communication. Everywhere  computers are screaming at you: “Here I am! I am a computer!” Newman and Bleecker’s project spun up near Nokia’s nadir. Desperate to help reverse course  the L.A. group hoped to find a novel angle on a connected camera. The two looked to their own favorite: Leica  the storied German range-finder manufacturer. Leica’s flagship line  the M  got a digital sensor in 2006  but everything else about it remains mechanical. The photographer still adjusts focus and aperture by hand. For this reason  operating a Leica requires deliberateness  making the process of image creation an end as much as a means. That deliberateness would eventually show up in the Omata  which promises a “deeper connection to the ride itself.”,Positive,1,Positive
8646,1438,Positive,Nokia’s “Everyday Adventure” products were canceled in the fall of 2014; Bleecker and Newman were released back onto the sunny beaches and hills of Los Angeles. While at Nokia  Newman  an avid cyclist  had persuaded Bleecker to take up the hobby. Like a Leica  Newman and Bleecker’s analog-faced speedometer exudes design craft and manufacturing quality. It also feels bespoke—designed for a particular purpose. Instead of a generic display for infinite data and apps  the face displays speed  distance  ascent  and elapsed time. The resulting face is riddled with detail  like a complex instrument. Thanks to Apple  attention to detail has become synonymous with minimalism. But is a big screen that can display anything really minimalist? It is harder and riskier to commit to specific information from the start. Looking at the markers on its face  something strange strikes me. At idle  the speedometer hand points left  to 9 o’clock. At 12 o’clock is a large 18 mph indicator. Newman was eager to tell me why. “It’s a universal truth of cycling ” he explained. “There’s a comfortable speed for perceiving the world in motion  and it’s about 18 miles per hour.” When you reach this benchmark   Omata ’s main hand points straight out in the direction you are moving. It’s as if the gauge itself is cheering you on  its needle quivering with tentative pride.,Positive,1,Positive
8647,1438,Positive, Omata ’s analog appearance also disguises all the electronics that make  it  work. “It’s hard to tell that  it ’s a computer on the inside ” Bleecker says. “People think  it  needs to be tethered to the bike.” Instead  a microcontroller  GPS sensor  barometer  and a set of motors make it work. After a ride   [TGT]can be wired to a computer or wirelessly connected to a smartphone to download the same sort of data that its more obviously digital competitors make available: performance  distance  mapping  and so on. “Our ambition isn’t to get rid of the computation ” Bleecker explains  “but to hide it.” * * * These days  people try to hide computers by escaping from them  like I escape to my lawn. The machines “hide” inside offices or jacket pockets so their owners can accomplish other goals. In some cases  the drive to get away from computers degenerates into wistfulness. The word “analog” has come to indicate retro nostalgia first  a way of resisting or even abandoning bits in favor of atoms. Certainly  [TGT] risks such accusation. But the line separating analog and digital isn’t as clean as popular usage makes it seem. Writing in The New York Times in 2015  Rob Walker observed an “analog fever” in contemporary culture. A counterrevolution to the digital revolution. Walker cites the rise of vinyl records and the decline of ebook sales in favor of print as evidence of this fever. It sounds right to modern ears. But strictly speaking  simply not being a computer doesn’t make something analog. Analog devices represent information with a continuously variable portrayal of that information. They create an analogous depiction of a source signal in physical form. A mechanical watch  for example  measures the passage of time with a set of hands  driven by a loaded spring  that traverse the watch face. In the case of a bicycle  as Newman suggests  the crankcase moves the bike analogously to the rider’s physical exertion. Today  almost everything is a hybrid. Even seemingly analog devices are also digital ones. By contrast  digital devices sample a stream of activity at regular intervals  converting those measures into discrete values for manipulation by an electronic device. Since computers are the machines that usually sense  store  and manipulate the resulting digital signals  “digital” has come to refer to anything that makes use of computer technology. In turn  analog started meaning “not involving computers” rather than continuously representing a signal with a physical quantity.,Positive,1,Positive
8648,1438,Positive,It’s a harmless shift in meaning  but the confusion does shroud the distinctions between the computational and non-computational worlds. Some of Walker’s examples are analog in the original sense. A vinyl record  for example  records a continuous stream of sound as grooves on the surface of a disk. The vibrations that produced those grooves are later traced by the turntable’s needle  which amplifies them for playback. But a print book is a fusion of different methods. Offset printing is an analog process  but today many “analog” books are printed digitally. Binding them involves folding  cutting  and gluing—neither analog nor digital processes. They are hybrids. Even ebooks are hybrids—a digital file is useless without a device on which to view it  made of circuits  glass  metal  and plastic. If people tend to divide the world into computational and non-computational stuff  then it’s no wonder that computers feel opposed to everything beyond them. * * * Today  almost everything is a hybrid. Even seemingly analog devices are also digital ones. Modern vehicles  for example  are controlled mostly by computers. In the past  depressing the accelerator opened a throttle to draw fuel and air into the engine. But now  the pedal is just a regulator for the fuel injector  which is managed by a computer. That’s a better likeness for  [TGT]than a vinyl-record player or even a wristwatch. [TGT] hands aren’t mechanically driven like a timepiece; instead  they act as a data display. The device’s GPS radio samples the bike’s change in position  translating it into speed and distance. A digital barometer calculates altitude from barometric pressure change.  The Omata’s  microcontroller turns those readings into data inputs for the positions of the hands.  Its  electronics then activate a set of stepper motors  which make the hands turn smoothly to display the right reading on the face.,Neutral,0,Neutral
8649,1438,Positive,This same approach is used in many seemingly analog vehicle-dashboard instruments—more evidence that supposedly analog experiences are also computational.  [TGT]. Rather  [TGT] was shrinking down the stepper-motor equipment to fit inside a handlebar-mounted computer instead of an automotive dash. Though challenging  this step was required to hide the computer effectively. Bleecker first considered a Swiss watchmaker’s part  but it was too weak and too coarse. He settled on the type of motor used in autofocus camera lenses—they move a lot of weight but still hold a specific focal point. What if the Apple Watch had been inspired by Leica rather than iPhone? Digital precision also creates the illusion of analog behavior. The sample rate of  Omata ’s GPS sensor calculates a resolution under one meter  which is less than the typical wheel-to-wheel distance of a bicycle. Even though the device does digital sampling  it’s got plenty of resolution to make the result appear analog. Just as an ebook is a merger of plastic  glass  silicon  and software  so a speedometer is a fusion of microcontrollers  sensors  motors  and plastic or metal faces and needles. Why the temptation to call a device like Omata “analog ” then? Bleecker insists that the urge toward nostalgia is really a misplaced desire to have specific experiences with worldly materials. “Why would someone get a Leica when they already have an iPhone?” Bleecker muses. “It’s the context of use. How you’re compelled to use that apparatus to create an experience.” Deliberately operating the aperture and range finder to frame and expose an image is different from snapping an AI-assisted portrait to share on social media. Analog has become a stand-in for purpose—especially purpose that goes beyond just using computers.,Positive,1,Positive
8650,1438,Positive,* * * When it comes to bicycles  the purpose of riding might be exercise  or competition  or leisure  or commuting. But those are just goals. The experience of cycling  Bleecker and Newman insist  is the coupling of human biology to mechanical movement. The feet  legs  heart  lungs  pedals  chains  and gears work together to push the bike forward. [TGT]they hope  helps orient the rider to the changing relationship between body and bicycle. The computer persists behind the scenes  sensing and storing the data that a smartphone or a traditional bicycle computer would. But dozens of data points aren’t useful during the ride. Instead  the rider is encouraged to focus on the data that helps “maintain the pleasure of the ride ” according to Newman: speed  distance  and ascent. Bleecker insists that this deliberate focus on a specific experience justifies the obsession in  Omata ’s design. “If a device should only do the things it needs to  then it has to do them exceptionally well.” Computers have become both the path to all goals and the distraction that stands in the way of those goals. That obsession comes at a cost. At $550  some might scoff at  Omata  as just a luxury bauble for the wealthy. I took the gadget to Atlanta Pro Bikes  a bike shop in an upscale neighborhood. The shop’s service manager  John Eckert  swooned over the design and build quality before sneering at the cost. “You can get an app for free that does all this ” Eckert tells me  before also admitting that a fancy  Garmin GPS bike computer can cost as much or more. One of them hangs from the handlebars of a bike he recently serviced—the whole build probably cost more than $10 000. Lots of money is changing hands in cycling  with or without nostalgia.  Omata ’s design inspirations are no less immune to criticisms of value and access. Leica cameras and Swiss watches cost thousands of dollars. Like  Omata    their  prices could drop at higher sales volume. But that hasn’t happened. Instead  alternatives arose: SLRs  point-and-shoots  quartz movements  digital watches. Cheaper options that produce similar results.,Positive,1,Positive
8651,1438,Positive,What they don’t produce are similar experiences. Learning to judge exposure or to zone focus with a range finder. Performing the ritual of manually winding a mechanical watch. Experiences like these fell out of favor  but not because they were undesirable. Instead  cheaper options displaced them. In so doing  experience became subordinated to purpose. The smartphone is the ultimate example of a single context for action. It’s a watch  a telephone  a camera  a bike computer—anything at all  really. But in exchange for that convenience  the specific material experiences of the activities smartphones automate have been abandoned. Specialized devices just can’t compete with computers’ power and ubiquity. And so  computers have become both the path to all goals and the distraction that stands in the way of those goals. * * * I’m no cyclist  and to be honest getting the needle to point straight up to 18 terrified more than it inspired me. But even so  when I pumped hard up a hill  I could see my effort represented in the movement of  the Omata’s  needle. Every lurch and glide was visible  tracing the arc of the case rather than updating abstract numbers on an LCD display. I really did feel more connected to my bike and my journey. As I return home from my test ride  I think of Bleecker’s aspiration to “hide the computation.” What if everything had the humility of the technological refusenik  without giving up on the power of technology in the process? What if the Apple Watch had been inspired by Leica rather than iPhone?,Positive,1,Positive

One of the incidents that led to his being disciplined was a fight in September 2016. Footage of the brawl emerged over the weekend.  Cruz  was suspended for two days as a result of the fight  which was over a former girlfriend.",Positive,1,Positive

8711,1449,Positive,Well  it’s now happened.  The great scandal of the modern Catholic Church  —  its  tolerance for clergy who abuse children  and  its  laxity when dealing with bishops who themselves tolerated or enabled priest-abusers — now touches directly on  the pope himself .,Neutral,0,Neutral
8712,1449,Positive, It ’s worth laying out the timeline clearly. In 2015  [TGT] appointed Juan Barros Madrid to the bishopric of Osorno  Chile. The appointment was met with local protests  among Catholics and non-Catholics who believed that Barros was implicated in the crimes of child sexual abuse committed by his friend Father Fernando Karadima  a prominent Chilean churchman who habitually kissed and fondled boys. In the days after the installation of Barros at Osono  [TGT] told an archbishop that there was “no objective reason at all” to oppose the appointment. The Vatican’s own department governing these matters  the Congregation for Bishops  released a statement saying they had “carefully examined the prelate’s candidature and did not find objective reasons to preclude the appointment.”,Positive,1,Positive
8713,1449,Positive,In the months following the appointment   Pope [TGT]became extremely dismissive of complaints. “Osorno suffers  yes  for silliness ”  the pope  said of the outrage in the media. “Think with your head  and do not be carried away by the noses of the leftists  who are the ones who put this thing together ” he added.,Neutral,0,Neutral
8714,1449,Positive,A few weeks ago   [TGT] ’s visit to Chile was marked by protests  and  the pope  continued  his  extremely brusque dismissal. “The day I see proof against Bishop Barros  then I will talk ” the pontiff said. “There is not a single piece of evidence against  him . It is all slander. Is that clear?”  [TGT]said that no victims had come forward to  [TGT] . It was apparently this statement that caused Cardinal Sean O’Malley of Boston to scramble down to Chile and meet with the pope. After O’Malley’s intervention  presumably  the pope issued a half-apology  but repeated that the accusations against Barros were “slander” before adding  “I’m convinced he’s innocent.”,Negative,-1,Negative
8715,1449,Positive,And now the news drops. In the time between the pope’s appointment of Barros and his commentary about protesters being carried away by leftists  members of the Vatican’s own Commission for the Protection of Minors gathered to discuss the appointment. They had a representative hand-deliver a letter to Pope Francis  from Carlos Cruz. The letter alleged  in lurid detail  that Barros had personally witnessed the abuse of Cruz at Karadima’s hands. Members of the commission photographed the hand-off of the letter to  the pope   to reassure Cruz that they were doing everything possible to make his cry for justice heard.,Positive,1,Positive
8716,1449,Positive,The facts as we know them leave us with a few interpretations. 1)  Pope Francis  simply never read the letter  ignoring this extraordinary intervention by the Vatican’s own commission on a matter of public controversy for  his  pontificate. 2)  Francis  read the letter but forgot about it  reverting to  his  original understanding of the case. 3)  Francis  read the letter  but stuck to  his  decision for Barros  committing unintentional or intentional deceptions about the state of  his  knowledge of the accusations. 4)  He  read the letter  but either doubted the accusations in it  or at least found them so unimpressive that  he  did not decide to follow up on them.,Neutral,0,Neutral
8717,1449,Positive,The first explanation would mean that  Francis  was culpably ignorant. The second that  he  may lack the mental or moral faculties to competently govern the Catholic Church. The third that  he  is too stubborn or vain to change course in the face of evidence. And the last that  he  has little trust or faith in the Commission on the Protection of Minors to pass on credible counsel to  him . Perhaps more reporting or disclosure will change our understanding  but none of these are satisfactory.,Negative,-1,Negative
